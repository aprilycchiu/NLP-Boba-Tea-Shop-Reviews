If you're not a boba fan they have other things you can add to your drink like lychee jellies. \\n\\nThey are very well priced compared to other places. You can order a 32 oz. for just $5 which is pretty reasonable. What makes things even better is the fresh fruit they use for their smoothies so there is no powdery taste. Their food is also good too, but I mainly stop by for their boba. I definitely recommend this place.\",\n",
       " 'what the heck?? came here because QQ Boba was closed, what a mistake. i ordered my usual peach green tea with lychee jelly and what i received was peach syrup and sugar with lychee jelly. way too sweet and cant taste the tea at all, im not trying to get diabetes! the guy doesnt know how to make tea, but my bf enjoyed his honeydew slush so theres my 2 stars. the employees are awkward and look miserable. i shall not return.',\n",

Thank you sooo much !!! U are too good !!!',\n",

They definitely have some health conscious choices and that's a plus for them. They also have macaron ice cream but a little on the expensive side. I guess they're expensive everywhere else too. \\n\\nThere's something about their boba i don't like. Sometimes is too chewy, I've had it once where I think it's undercooked and times where it's just perfect. It's a hit or miss really. I order the same thing over and over and it's never made the same. They don't offer to remake it for you either like other places either.\",\n",

No where can compare. If you haven't tried this place yet, please go try it!!! This place uses fresh fruit instead of powders so it tastes so refreshing. My favorite drinks are Mango Green Tea, Passion Fruit Green Tea, Cantaloupe Slush, Mango Slush, and Watermelon Slush:)\",\n",
       " \"It's been years since I had a craving for Boba.  Unfortunately playing around on yelp got the best of me.  I saw this place and started reading reviews... didn't think anything of it at first, but then 2 days later I saw it again... ugh.. .so 10min later I'm driving down here with the girlfriend... oh well... time to give it a shot.  Had the blueberry/strawberry smoothie and it was awesome!.. Service was friendly and super sweet...  both mine and the girlfriend's smoothies/bobas tasted great... fresh fruit and the such.. reminded me back of orange county trying it for the first time.  Unfortunately been back quite a few times to No1 since then... I didn't need another new habit =/\",\n",
       " \"I wasn't hungry for lunch but was craving a fruity boba so I headed here after reading all the good reviews. \\n\\nThey had so many different flavor combinations, I almost couldn't decide what I wanted. I went with the lychee and coconut slush with boba. They had quite a few size options, even 32 oz, which I don't think I have seen too often for boba. The price is pretty good so I think I'd get that if I was going to share or something on my next visit. They also have a full food menu and I'm really curious about this for my next visit as well. My drink was really good. Not overly sweet and the boba had a really nice texture unlike a lot of other places I have tried in the city. \\n\\nI will definitely be back, I really like this place.\",\n",
       " \"I've been going here for years now. When I do cheat because they are closed or I'm not in the area, I still regret I didn't go to the Fort Apache and Flamingo location. The staff is always friendly and the customer area is clean. They always use fresh fruit when in season. They are always willing to fix people's drinks. Sometimes we've been 5 times a week so we see a lot of the interactions. Their boba is nice and chewy and sweetened with honey. I love that they have the sealed lids for every size but the extra large. Only negative is I wish they had grass jelly.\",\n",

The boba is cooked perfectly and always fresh. They offer different flavors and uses fresh fruit to their drink.\\n\\nMy favorite drink right now is peach green tea, it is so refreshing and you can taste the peach flavor in the drink. I had different boba such as, milk tea, apple green tea, matcha green tea, cantaloupe, honey dew, mango, taro (powdered/fresh) you can make it half/half if you requested, lychee and coconut, pineapple and coconut, and passion fruit. I always get it with boba because it tasted better.',\n",

I always get the coconut smoothie with boba and lychee jelly.  China Town serves it up quick, perfectly and with gracious smiles.  Eastern?  Not so much.\\n\\nOrdered my usual coconut with boba and lychee jelly.  There was only one other party ahead of me (three drinks) and yet the cashier seemed harried, as did the two others who were making the drinks.  No smiles.  No greeting.  Looking very irritated to be there.  Ugh...minus one star for the non-stellar customer service.\\n\\nWhile waiting, I used the restroom.  No toilet paper and no paper towels.  Ugh...minus another star for, well, you know.\\n\\nThe drink came and while it tasted fine, it was barely frozen.  After 5 minutes of driving with the AC blasting, my smoothie had turned completely liquid with a bunch of boba and jelly piled at the bottom.  Ugh...yet another star subtracted.\\n\\nThey receive two stars from me...one for the fact that they actually have lychee jelly (most places don't) and the other star for their comfy chairs near the pick-up window.  \\n\\nAs much of a long haul as it is for me to go to the other side of town, I'll pass on this store and head to China Town for all my boba and lychee jelly needs.\",\n",

I ordered a boba milk tea with pudding and it was delicious. Prices are decent for the size of the drink. \\n\\nBoba was soft and chewy. My friend ordered 4 drinks, they gave her 2 drinks that were a size larger than what she originally ordered. We checked the receipt and she was charged for the larger size...

The service is always fast and friendly. Sure, they don't all speak perfect English, but as long as you make sure you get your orders in correctly, there will be no fuss and confusion.

They don't clean the blenders properly even when we can see them just throwing some water on them.

Turn it into an icee, slushy drink with such a pleasant variety of texture, combined with the squishy tapioca Boba and you've got an ON POINT experience.  The only thing that turned me off from this amazing experience was the staff.  They seemed too flustered and didn't really pay attention to me when they took my order.  This young guy seemed all over the place and I found myself repeating my order a couple times, which irritated me a little.  Still wouldn't stop me from coming back again.  The Boba Tea is that good!\\n\\nIf you have not tried Boba Tea, you are definitely missing out.  They have every flavor in the book and you will love it all!  My other favorite is the Thai Tea Boba.  Definitely a must try as well!\",\n",

There is a list that spans one whole wall of the restaurant behind the counter and TONS of options.  Whatever your fruity craving is, I bet they have that flavor.  \\n\\nFinally decided on a strawberry/pomegranate slush (I think #61 - how do they memorize all of these?  She knew which it was without looking, lol).  The employee, who was quiet but friendly, asked if I wanted to add Boba.  I\\'d never tried it before and it was included in the price of the drink so, why not?  \\n\\nFYI: the charge to pay with a card is 35 cents.  \\n\\nMy drink was ready quickly and I was pleased with the presentation.  If you\\'ve never had this experience before (and I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m the only one, but I\\'ll describe it just in case), the cup is covered with a film that is attached to the top and you poke a large straw through it to enjoy your beverage.  The straw has to be wide to bring up those boba pearls, which you can clearly see on the bottom of your drink.  Now I don\\'t know what these pearls are comprised of, but they are chewy and jelly-like, although they were pretty tasteless to me.  The girl who made my drink put a really good ratio of boba to slush and I was bringing them up pretty much the entire time. \\n\\nHere\\'s my dirty little secret: I don\\'t like the boba.  I didn\\'t enjoy the texture and it didn\\'t have much of a taste to me so I\\'m going to skip it next time (I know some of you probably just gasped - \"NO BOBA?!?\" - because I\\'ve read how much you like it, lol).  I just didn\\'t \"get it\".  But my drink itself was INCREDIBLE.  Perfect amount of sweetness and fruitiness and it seriously hit the spot.  Mine was a non-dairy slush so I\\'m looking forward to trying many other flavors and some of the smoothie flavors too.  \\n\\nThey serve food, which I\\'m curious to try, but the drinks are filling so I\\'m wondering when I\\'ll get the chance to try any of it.  The decor is very simple and almost \"bare\".  The prices are really reasonable for the drinks.

Having been to QQ Boba a few times recently, I figured it was time to give the inferior location of No. 1 Boba Tea a second try.\\n\\nIt was a weekday afternoon, and there were two employees and zero other customers. I quickly decided on the mango smoothie, the same problem product from my first visit and a favorite of mine from the Chinatown Mall location. It was $3.95 for a 24 oz cup, boba included.\\n\\nAs with the other location, you can tell that there is real fruit because they cut it up in plain view. There is a significant difference between real mango and other things purporting to be mango, and there was real mango flavor in my smoothie. The boba was pretty nice and chewy, not overdone. There was one problem that I noticed more and more as I consumed the smoothie though: it was way too sweet. I'm a guy who normally asks for no sugar adjustments, and I didn't ask for any this time, so I was shocked that the flavor was unpleasantly sweet at times even for me.\\n\\nI will probably try this location again if I'm in the area and I really want fresh fruit, but for more consistent sweet drinks with (or without) boba, I will stick to QQ Boba or the Chinatown Mall location of No. 1 Boba Tea.\",\n",

I wish their recipe hadn't changed.\\n\\nTheir Black Sesame Smoothie with Boba (boba is optional) super-reminded me of Chinese black sesame soup, usually served as a dessert. It had tiny pieces of crushed sesame and was delicious. I coughed a couple of times from the texture, yet, I still recommend it. The Durian Smoothie with Boba had a very smooth texture and was full of fresh durian flavor.\",\n",

Just there to get your order and payment. Nothing more. I have ordered the Taro Milk Tea, Taro Smoothie, and the Mango Passion Fruit Smoothie before.

They get a star for having a stamp card, but lose a star for charging extra to use a card instead of cash. \\nSo to review the drink, there are much better places around town. The drink itself tasted like it was made with powder flavor. The drink melted so fast, even though I was sitting inside. And halfway through my drink, the boba pearls were getting frozen. I hate frozen boba!!! Needless to say, I'm still looking for a decent place for boba on this side of town:( driving all the way to china town for good boba isn't always practical.\",\n",

I'm greedy like that.\\n\\nTheir Thai Boba Milk Tea was a little on the sweet side, but expectedly so. Their Jasmine Boba Tea was super delicious and rich in flavor. Their Avocado Boba Smoothie, made from fresh avocados in front of me, was satisfying and quite filling. It could be a meal. \\n\\nThe service here was quick, polite, and very friendly.

The problem is that now they are no longer for vegans, because of the honey, and they don't make any without honey. They have jellies, but they have gelatin. So again, no options.

I obviously am not the only one that feels this way because despite the hard-to-find location, this place has been booming with business in the last year.

The last time I was here, the block they were trying to shave from kept slipping off their machine so I didn't get the beautiful ribbons of snow that I like. \\n\\nPerhaps if service came with a smile or if there was a sense of urgency to it, I might like this place more. For now they get my business because of convenience.\",\n",

The strawberry boba was not very sweet but still tasty maybe if it's mixed with another fruit/flavor it would sweeten it a bit more. The almond milk tea was very amoretto tasting which wasn't what I was expecting but it wasn't bad. The coffee would probably be perfect to pair with it who knows. While the drinks were leaving a bit to be desired the amount of boba they give you is generous. The texture was perfect and added that awesome gummy treat with each sip. I'll give them another try since they seem promising and that many positive reviews can't all be wrong.\",\n",

We asked the lady (who was pregnant) if we can try the boba because we wanted to know how it taste. Coming from Los Angeles, we have honey boba so we're kind of spoil and picky about our boba. The lady looked at us like we were just born and told us it was boba.\\n\\nWith that sign, we should've walked away. We order the taro milk tea with boba and OMG, it put me into a diabetic coma! It seems like that accidentally pour the whole powder in the milk tea. The boba tasted like crap. Beware, this place WILL give you diabetes.\",\n",

I've tried a couple different flavors but I keep going back to the Taro, the slushy one with boba. \\n\\nEmployees all seem to be friendly & usually move quickly making drinks. It isn't always that busy when I pop in. Prices are very reasonable. They have a program after you purchase 10 (I believe that's the correct #) drinks, when you give them your phone number you get a free drink (forgot the flavor as you don't get to chose) or a certain amt. of money off any drink. \\n\\nThere was only one time I felt my Tara had no taste to it. I think they use a powder flavoring so I'm wondering if the person who made the drink didn't put the required amt. in it. As I sat in my car taking a few sips of it I contemplated on going back inside to get a new one but I ended up not. Luckily this has only happened once. \\n\\nOnly one bad thing I have to mention is on one of my visits while I was waiting for my drink I was watching this male employees making a drink & he had used a scoop to scoop some ingredient into a cup & he took the scoop & banged it against the trash can rim that was next to him....YUCK!! He took something that should be somewhat clean & touched a dirty trash can with it that had trash in it....WHY? Not sure. I was sooo tempted to say something to him but I didn't. He wasn't making my drink....I know, shame on me. Hopefully if the owner or manager/employees read their YELP reviews they can go over the importance of not touching dirty trash cans with their serving utensils & give them some extra training on this, something that they all should know not to do.\",\n",

       " \"Seriously, the specialty drinks at this place is very plain, nothing special at all. Even though the drink is on promotion, I still don't think it is worth the price. The variety of drinks in this place is relatively less than other bbt store. The food I order tasted worst than a neighbourhood snack store and waited for almost half hour which is unacceptable.\",\n",
       " 'I was on my way to Dear and Fro Tuesday afternoon when my partner noticed a grand opening special for the large mango juice and roasted milk tea for $2.99 each. I thought it sounded like a good deal, so I made a memo to drop by after desserts next door.\\n\\nWe came back about an hour later in the afternoon and the cafe was completely empty minus the actual employees at the time. I ordered the roasted milk tea which based on the picture, I thought would come with the tapioca. The cashier informed me not. I\\'m not sure if this is mentioned in the fine print but I\\'d sure hope so to avoid further mishap. I added tapioca for an additional $0.50.\\n\\nMy partner got the mango juice and for 2 larges, it came up to just under $8 for both. A pretty good deal imo.\\n\\nWe waited about 5 minutes for the drinks to be made. We got them on the go and one of their male employees asked us if we wanted to stick around to play some board games, which I thought was pretty nice of him. \\n\\nAs for the drinks themselves, I liked my Roasted MT with tapioca. I guess they improved on their Roasted* taste based on previous reviews because each exhale that followed a sip was aromatic. \\n\\nAs for my partner, their mango juice had real mango pulp in it! She said it was \"better than Chatime.\" What a compliment. I wouldn\\'t say the Roasted MT is on par with a competitor such as Chatime yet, but for a decent drink at a pricepoint of $3.49, there\\'s little for me to complain about.',\n",
       " 'The service in this place is honestly garbage. I don\\'t normally give reviews, much less 1 star reviews, but this boardgame cafe only owns up to one part of their name: game, since all they do is play their customers. They talk down to customers and are generally super rude -- even online! If you check any reviews that are 1 star, their replies are all excuses or are offensive comments. It is very rare that they ever apologize and acknowledge their wrongdoing although bonds with customers are what sustain their business. It is extremely disappointing as well to see employees (Thomas Y., Who is mentioned to be an employee in other customer reviews and also in replies from the owner) play acting as a customer and responding to reviews by calling people names using homophobic slurs and saying they are \"cheap ungrateful kids that don\\'t understand business policies\" and should \"grow up\". It\\'s disgusting how you insult people reviewing your business objectively with personal problematic attacks and it seems that the only people that need to \"grow up\" is the condescending and frankly ludicrous \"twilight family.\" What business bans a group of \"ungrateful kids\" that still paid money for what they bought for leaving reviews that expressed dissatisfaction and warned potential goers of your cafe of additional fees? Not only does this sound like censorship but it also sounds like you are intentionally scamming people who are unaware you charge extra for things boardgame cafes don\\'t charge for usually (aka the boardgames) and are now angry that you have been exposed online. Through responses to reviews and the rude service in the cafe itself, I can promise that this cafe will no longer receive my business nor those of my friends. Goodnight, and grow up.',\n",
       " \"Summary: beware if you order their drinks and do NOT get any toppings. They might typecast you customers as being cheap and do NOT understand that some people actually don't want toppings with their drinks!\\n\\nAnother BBT place has opened up in finch and midland and this one is a BBT/ board game place. I first noticed this place last sat when I was in the same plaza for a tasting. Intrigued, I took a pic and told a few friends this new place is also selling Lady M crepe cake. Fast fwd a few days later, I was back in the area. Even though my friend and I already went to Happy Lemon and Smile Dessert, I wanted to go check it out since I wasn't sure when I would be back. A friend mentioned this place has a current grand opening promotion special: $2.99 for a large roasted classic milk tea or a mango green tea. Sounds too good to be true, eh? Upon entering, we were greeted by the female employee. She was ok and helpful. For a new place that just opened up a week ago and for a Monday, this place was packed. Practically all tables were occupied with people playing board games. I didn't know whether the employee spoke Mandarin or Cantonese so I spoke to her in English. Since we already ate and drank, we decided to get bbt to go. I couldn't decide between the 2 specials drinks so I got both and also treated my friend to 1 drink. That's 3 drinks in total and over $10. This is where things get interesting. \\n\\nUpon paying, the girl said she would called me when the order was ready so I stood on the side waiting for my order. A male employee quickly came over to make the drinks and asked her in Canto whether we asked for toppings. She said no toppings. He said of course they aren't getting any toppings when the toppings aren't free or included with the drinks! I was stunned by what he just uttered and how he just made that assumption. I was also taken aback on how he could said things like that and just stood there making fun of its customers behind their back. They also assumed I couldn't understand Canto because I ordered in English. Imagine had I ordered in Cantonese. Would they dare said things like that? The girl turned around and said the drinks were almost ready. I replied back with a thank you in Cantonese. This is the moment where they both realised I clearly heard and understood what they just said about me and my friend.\\n\\nI told my friend what happened and we went back to the counter to get our drinks. Initially the girl was the one handling our order and the guy was clearly trying to avoid me and my friend by passing the drinks to the girl but then the girl got called away as more customers came in. After the guy gave us our final drink, my friend frankly told him the reason why we ordered our roasted classic milk tea without any toppings was because we wanted to see how their tea would taste and didn't want the toppings to ruin the taste of the drink. The male employee acknowledged quickly that he is always joking. That was pretty much his reasoning. He is always joking! No excuse whatsoever. Not even an apology.\\n\\nAs for the drinks, not even a saving grace to receive another star. It was pretty much watered down. There was barely any tea taste. Save your money and go elsewhere. Why adv such promotion if you are going to offer such a subpar product?  Isn't the whole point of offering this special is to attract customers to come inside and possibly have repeat customers? There are so many BBT places around the area that you don't have to put up with this kind of arrogant attitude. I got so turned off by the lack of disrespect that I will never go back.  I was told by a friend who went there a few times already that the mgr is a much more nicer person and who knows, I would have received a better service and it would have made my exp. different.I regret spending money on the so called drinks as I could have went a few doors down to get a REAL drink. Beware if you get their drinks and do not order any toppings. They might assumed right off the back that you are cheap and do NOT understand that some people actually don't want toppings. Toppings can make drinks even more sweeter than usual for ex!\\n\\n*****In response to the owner's reply, NO your employee never explained or said anything about this cafe being new and everyone was learning. Not sure what conversation he had with but it was clearly not us.  Maybe he was trying to save his job. We never agreed to what he said and all he said was he was joking TWICE. A simple apology would have sufficed but your employee felt it was not warranted nor needed.  I visited so many BBT places and never had such experience. This is a 1st! Being new is no excuse for lack of disrespect, insulting and derogatory comments from your employee. FYI, despite the place being packed, we never waited in line on a MONDAY. We were served quickly upon entrance and no confusion or mix up . Let this be a lesson to your employees to be careful on what they utter in front of customers.\",\n",
       " \"It's a good concept with all the board games and all but I am definitely not a fan of their drinks. I got the purple butterfly which just did not taste good in my opinion.

       " \"Just like I rarely give out 5 star reviews, I also rarely give out 1 star reviews. But the bubble tea here is just bad. I ordered roasted milk tea. There is no tea taste and there is no roast taste. All I taste is milk ( real milk or powdered milk? I don't even know) \\n\\nAlso, reading the previous reviews from yelper and the replies from owner, it doesn't sound very welcoming. There's always both sides to a story, but to publicly call your customers disrespectful and uncultured, What does this say about the business and the people working there? \\n\\nI'm a business owner myself and I understand how difficult it is to open a business but there is nothing more important than giving your customers respect and service. I would never call my customers disrespectful and uncultured, especially in a public forum. \\n\\nBut service aside, If you cannot do right on a simple roasted milk tea, then you have failed as a bubble tea shop. There's just way too many way better choices out there. \\n\\nThe business owner is right in that this is a board game cafe. So stop serving bubble tea! Charge your customers $1 for a can of pop, or a flat fee for playing boardgames. Business owner you may also want to look into changing the yelp business category. People are coming for bubble tea and food when they should be coming here for boardgames. \\n\\nMisleading info leads to unrealistic expectations which leads to bad reviews. \\n\\nI see potential in this place. And the fact that I am writing such a long review is because I hope the business owner would reflect on these reviews. Instead of defending your business and your employees, take these reviews as constructive criticism and thank your customers for taking the time to tell you what can be improved. They ARE the reviews that will make your business BETTER.\",\n",
       " \"Had a quite good experience dining and gaming here! Had no intention on dropping in but my favorite dessert spot in this same plaza was packed with a line up to the door. Enticed by the $2.99 grand opening special sign, and eventually the cleanly interior and board games, I unexpectedly spent 3 hrs here having a fun time.\\n\\nIn light of the negative reviews, I'm hoping the management reflecting on the customer feedback had much to do with the good service I received. If dining in to play games, you order at the counter to start a tab at your table. It's 1 hour per person per 3 hours if playing games, with an increase to $10 minimum per person per 3 hours on Fri-Sun. This wasn't told to us until we had been playing for 20 min but no problem. We were more than happy to stay, even though the restaurant was full and every table occupied, never did we feel rushed to leave.\\n\\nThe milk tea itself was very good! Not the place for premium quality tea or made to brew tea but definitely not subpar. Did not taste stale or underwhelming. The classic milk tea had a better taste over the roasted milk tea in my opinion. 4/5\\n\\nBeverage selection is delightfully up to speed as they had butterfly pea tea and drinks topped with ice cream. Worth trying out next time around.\\n\\nWe also ordered the cheese toast but felt it fell below our expectations. It was essentially toast with cheese wiz, toasted with condensed milk and slices almonds which sounds good except it was served on of slices of Wonderbread, not brick toast. 2/5\\n\\nExtensive and exciting board game selection was their saving grace. I was entertained the whole way through and have already invited friends to meet here sometime to play and snack. I was really content with my first experience here.\\n\\nThe second time I came by for a drink to go, it took a whopping 25 minutes to receive my drink. In the most forgiving way there are lots operational kinks they still need to straighten out as well as better communication with customers. It would have been nice to be told they were brewing a fresh batch of tea as soon as they knew, not only when 5 orders after ours had received their drinks and I had to ask what the hold up was. Would have left much more frustrated than I did but the employee did apologize. They just need to be more proactive than reactive, especially with such tight competition for a cup of cha in this area. Optimistic they'll hit 4 stars for next visit!\",\n",
       " \"Came here on a Wednesday night at around 9pm. The cafe was 80% full. My friends and I came here with the intention of playing board games. I can't remember if you have to get a drink or if there is no minimum if you stay on a weekday (Mon-Thurs). If you stay on Fri-Sun, you have to spend a minimum of $10 every 3 hours to stay. That sounds fair to me...they're trying to make profit on their busiest days. And instead of paying the sitting fee, you can use that money towards food or drink. \\n\\nThey have a good variety of board games, the games are labeled with stickers based on the level of difficulty, two players game and/or party game. We played four of their games and they are in good condition with all the games pieces intact. \\n\\nI ordered the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. I tried my friend's drink with tapioca. The tapioca tastes better than grass jelly. \\nI would say my drink taste average - there are other bubble tea places around the plaza that tastes better, as well as bubble tea places that tastes worse. \\nI would come back to play board games and will give their drink another shot.\",\n",

My brother picked up the vanilla milk tea for me and it was lacking a bit of tea flavour. Obviously the bigger chains like Chatime do have their drinks perfected, but maybe revisiting the recipe could help a lot. I guess their main focal point are the board games, which they do have a large variety of. \\n\\nThere are also some questionable reviews on both Yelp and Google Reviews about this place being amazing with nice staff and a \"handsome owner\". If you\\'re going to get your friends or staff to write reviews, at least make them believable. Not sure if this is true or not, but I guess if customers feel strongly about their opinion, then they are allowed to say those things. \\n\\nUpdate: manager or owner left a \"compliment\" and sent a message explaining the situation in a professional way which was a nice change from previous comments written. \\nHe accused me of not trying the drinks and only defending someone else who had a bad experience, but I actually have tried their vanilla milk tea when they first opened and totally forgot (always wanted to review but never really used Yelp and finally got around to downloading it).',\n",

It took 30mins for someone to finally take our orders despite ringing the bell several times....ordering at the cash register would've been faster.

I understand that its main focus is boardgames but if the catch is to order from their menu the drinks and food should at least taste decent.\\n\\nWe ordered the mango green tea, blue velvet and original milk tea. The blue velvet is visually appealing and great for pics  but it literally just tastes like milk with little to no other flavour. My friend paid over $7 for milk....? I had asked for less sugar for my mango green tea and really would have appreciated if they had informed me that less sugar means it'll just be watered down. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we didn't finish those drinks. The boardgames were nice and new but that's not nearly enough reason to return.

I came around three weeks ago and at that time, it had just opened and there wasn't much commotion because it was 2 pm in the afternoon. \\n\\nThe interior of the cafe is definitely my favorite part - marble tables, cute frames and a wooden floor. Since it is brand new, the place is also very clean. To add to the ambiance of the atmosphere, they should play some music in the background! \\n\\nUnexpectedly, we spent around an hour in the cafe playing cards and it had more than 200 + board games. There were only two tables occupied when we came and the noise level was perfect enough for you to carry a conversation while not being too loud. Since we came around the grand opening, the menu wasn't up on the board yet so we ordered the 2.99$ specials- roasted milk tea. \\n\\nThe milk tea itself was good - similar to the Alley in my opinion. I usually get less ice and extra sugar and it was just how I wanted it. It was nothing too excellent but it wasn't bad either. Not sure what the regular price is but for 2.99, it was a good buy. (4/5)\\n\\nIn light of the negative reviews, I was quite shocked because the experience I had was very pleasant - the staff there was very kind and talked to us about its opening, the service was very quick and its optimism about the store in the future. I really fell in love with the place and even told my friends to take a visit. I really hope management takes a look at the reviews and works to fix up the issues because Twilight Cafe has really great potential to be a big hit. \\n\\nI also wasn't aware that we had to pay to sit down to play games but perhaps that's because I went during it's opening week.

Both times they tasted very average. There was one time I got the original milk tea with grass jelly. The grass jelly was floating which means... it was very soft and thin.

I ordered the Purple Butterfly (tastes like the mini yakult yogurt drink) & my friend ordered the Blue Butterfly (tastes like sprite with coconut water).

I've been to various Real Fruit Bubble Teas around the city and pretty frequently too, but this location astounded me with how incompetent the staff were and the extremely poor quality of their drinks.\\n\\nFirst off, the shop itself is very small and cramped. You could probably fit only 4-5 people inside the standing area and everyone had to squeeze out of the way pretty often since the staff had to walk to the fridge which is located in the waiting area instead of behind the counter. The shop was also stuffy even though it was only 18 degrees out.\\n\\nSecondly, the girl working the cashier when I went in today was incredibly incompetent. She kept getting the size wrong and had me repeat my order to her even though I was literally just getting one of their fresh juices with tapioca. She also forgot to give me my change, meaning she didn't even bother counting the money I gave her and just assumed I gave her the exact amount (my total was $9.36 and I gave her $9.50 so I did not ask for this change back, however it bothers me that she did not know how to simply add the two quarters that I gave her to equal $0.50 instead of $0.35). She also input the wrong size when my boyfriend ordered his drink.\\n\\nLastly, and this is the part that upset me the most, my drink tasted terrible. I got the fresh watermelon juice which I have gotten a few times before from other Real Fruit Bubble Tea locations and they all ended up tasting refreshing and sweet. The one I got at this location was horrible. I am not exaggerating when I say that it was bitter, warm and the last sips made me gag a little. I had my boyfriend try it, and he was also shocked at how bitter it turned out. I have no idea if their watermelons were simply not ripe enough or had gone bad but it was the worst drink I've ever had, period. \\n\\nOverall, I am very disappointed with this new location.

The bubble tea was on the pricier end for $5.35 for large size, but hey there's a Yelp coupon that gives you a dollar off any size drink. For the quality ingredients that the store is offering I think the pricing is fair, would pay $6 (including tax) to support a local quality tea shop than somewhere like Starbucks.\\n\\nThe owner was actually running the store when I came around noon today and she was really friendly. The store wasn't busy that time and my friend and I had a nice chat with her. The owner was attentive and asked for our suggestions on how to improve the tea shop.

Their drinks are full of interesting blends and uniqueness to it, but...\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\nI couldn't taste any matcha - even though its what they specialize in. Now I only tried two drinks, so I would go back to give it a try again. Who knows, it may change my mind :)\\n\\nThe neutral:\\n\\nI was able to get a seat, but don't expect one if it's busy because there are only 4-5 spots.\",\n",
       " 'I love Nohohon! The staff are very friendly and happy to answer any of your questions. They have a delicious selection of teas and jellies and can make anything dairy-free for you. The spiced hot chocolate is really nice too, and the matcha quality is excellent even for lattes and specialty teas.',\n",

       " \"If I lived closer to this tea house, I'd likely become a daily spender. By far my favourite is the hot taro latte with soy milk. Its sweet, with chunks of real taro and is the perfect companion for a cold day. \\n\\nI've also had their Tokyo Fog (hot) and their Matcha Macchiato (cold). It's no lie that their matcha is top quality. Each of their drinks is on the sweeter side but don't let that comment take away from the bitterness that is matcha. Nohohon maintains the matcha flavour profile while adding their touch of hazelnut (Tokyo fog) and caramel (matcha macchiato) to differentiate each drink. \\n\\nIf I'm even remotely close to the area I make an effort to swing by. It's worth the average of $5 per drink lol. However beware that if you are coming with a large group there is only enough seating capacity in this tea house for 6!\\n\\nWill definitely be back soon!!\",\n",

The store looked quite nice in the front but inside.....beside the counter the poor gentleman was being swarmed alive by fruit flies. \\n\\nI felt so bad for the guy and I just hope i didnt consume too many of those little flies inside my drink. The drink that he made was just way too sweet and I wouldve preferred abit more thickness in the beverage. Perhaps this was aimed towards the younger crowd.\\n\\nI just hope that poor server guy survived.',\n",

       " \"This is one of the cutest bubble tea places I've been to! It is a Japanese tea house setting inside and though it's small with about 8 seats, it's charming. \\n\\nI ordered the fresh taro smoothie with soy milk and tapioca, which really did taste fresh! My husband got the Tokyo Fog (matcha with vanilla) and tapioca. Both were delicious, though I would personally get the taro again on my next visit. \\n\\nThe only con is the wait time. I waited about 15 minutes for my drink even though there were only 2 people in front of me. To be fair though, there was only one person working - he was at the cash register and making the drinks. Time and care was obviously put into the drinks though. Good customer service and $1 off when you check in on Yelp! Definitely recommend this place and will go back when I'm in the area.\",\n",
       " \"After  finishing lunch in the area, my friends and I were craving some bubble tea and were intrigued by the drink descriptions and pictures from Yelp! The establishment itself is very small (two four-person tables and one two-seater) so don't expect to stay there on a crowded day. There was one very sweet lady behind the counter running the show by herself. I absolutely loved her bright attitude, but in terms of efficiency, expect to have to wait to place your order let alone get your drink if there's more than three people in line. \\n\\nAs for the drinks itself, I ordered the Green Haze (matcha tea with hazelnut cream, red bean, and tapioca) while others got the Vanillabrew. My Green Haze looked amazing, with the vibrant colors and layers. The redbean and tapioca were fine but I didn't quite enjoy the blend of the matcha powder with the milk. My companions were even less fans of the Vanillabrew, which frankly, tasted mostly like water. \\n\\nOverall, a very cute tea shop which probably specializes in tea (I'm assuming,) moreso than the actual sweet dessert drinks. If you're looking for a bubble tea fix, I might look elsewhere.\",\n",

A nice change from your typically super sweet creamy bubble teas.\\n\\nTip - check in to get $1 off your drink!',\n",

       " 'Fantastic bubble tea without artificial sweeteners or ingredients. Amazing service and lovely atmosphere. Among the best bubble tea I have had in Taiwan, Vancouver or Toronto! The owner is so nice and clearly passionate about her store and her products!',\n",
       " \"I went here for the first time this afternoon. I was able to have a conversation with the owner (a lovely Japanese women). She explained the concept behind her Cafe and I was nothing short of impressed! Most bubble tea stores use powders to make their drinks. The powders and not only unnatural, but laden with sugar. At Nohohon, all the ingredients are fresh! If you are lactose intolerant, they have almond milk and soy. I ordered a green tea, vanilla latte with almond milk and red bean (the red beans were in place of tapioca). It was delicious! The staff are very friendly as well, which made the experience even better. I will definitely be visiting Nohohon again! It's important to have healthier option of the foods we love and Nohohon had done that for Toronto with bubble tea.\",\n",
       " 'I love this place!! Excellent selection of teas that are rich with flavour, but do not taste artificial. Since I am lactose intolerant, I love the soy and almond milk options that I have yet to see at any other bubble tea stores. The tapioca is always fresh and soft, creating the perfect combination of taste and texture.\\n\\nMy recommendation would be the taro smoothie with tapioca ( made with almond milk) or the hazelnut matcha bubbletea !',\n",
       " \"I was pretty disappointed with the drinks I ordered here. Usually, I love anything that is flavoured with matcha, but the Tokyo Fog really didn't impress me. Firstly, my drink wasn't filled to the top of my cup. Something like that usually doesn't bother me, but there was a significant amount missing (you can see from the pictures). I also couldn't taste any vanilla flavour as the menu described. :( I know the aim of this store is to be healthier so they probably use less sugar, but my drink basically tasted like matcha and water mixed together (and not well I might add because I could still taste a lot of powder). The tapioca texture was nice though!\\nMy friend ordered the Matcha Macchiato and she didn't enjoy her drink either. Although I have a feeling my drink might've been made wrong as it tastes completed different than how it is described on their Instagram post. And also because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it. I'm willing to give this place another try as they are still new and staff probably needs more practice making consistent drinks. The staff at cash was really friendly though! :)\",\n",

I had the green haze with lychee jelly both as a warm drink and as a hot drink, and they were amazing both times, though I preferred the cold drink by just the tiniest bit more. I also had a cold taro bubble tea which was really good. I am impressed that they make their taro paste from fresh taro. We were warned by the barista that the taro drink was very sweet, but I was surprisingly not too bothered by the sweetness. I think it would have been very good warm as well.\\n\\nFor those travelling from another country, this shop takes Visa cards.',\n",

I would say this location is up to par with other Ding Tea and one of the better shops of boba scene in Vegas. \\n\\nService is friendly. Though employees are still working out the kinks and under training, I'd say it was pretty organized considering it is only their first week.\\n\\nI ordered the oolong milk tea and added light golden boba. I paid around $4.70 for the large which I think is decently priced. Drink came out in few minutes and upon receiving, was told that I was able to make adjustments if needed.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, their drink is pretty sugary. Make use of their sweetness adjustments! I have a sweet tooth but even for me....it was too sweet at 100% sweetness. I'd go a scale down next time. Boba had a nice texture and hint of honey flavor. Besides the sweetness issue, I wish it was more creamy but oolong had prominent tea flavor so I would say drink + boba was on point. (Taste similar to KFT's oolong milk tea in my opinion, but a lot sweeter and less creamy)\\n\\nOne thing I didn't like about this location with the comparison of other Ding Tea is their interior and decor. I personally think their artwork doesn't go well with the rest of the interior. Too cutesy in my opinion. Also with their menu on each table, made the place look and feel like it was a dining restaurant than a boba shop. Wish it was more casual/hipster like the other location. But that's just my personal preference.\\n\\nOverall, not bad! Looking forward to visiting more and trying out more drinks in the future!\",\n",
       " \"Nothing about this new place stood out to me. The staff was extremely mediocre, the boba was hard, and there were flies everywhere. Usually if I'm going to a new place that just opened, the staff would be very bubbly and upbeat but the staff here literally made it feel like my questions were a bother to them. I definitely don't think I will be returning.\",\n",
       " 'DRINKS\\nSurprisingly better than I anticipated, and they are easily in my top 5 boba shops that I\\'ll visit in the Chinatown area. I ordered a taro milk tea with rainbow jelly, and green milk tea with grass jelly, both with 75% sweetness. I personally enjoy the bitterness and strong tea flavor, so I always go for 75% sweet but I could see why the other reviews mention it being \"too sweet.\" The taro is a basic milk tea mixture, nothing fresh about it like how Brew Tea or Mr. Tea makes it. However, the green milk tea actually has a strong tea flavor similar to Brew Tea, and that is where a lot of other boba shops lacks. As for toppings, I\\'ve only tried the grass jelly, rainbow jelly, and clear boba; they were all very good. I have yet to try their boba because I am very picky and need it to be super chewy. \\n\\nSERVICE\\nIt\\'s in a quiet shopping center and the few times that I\\'ve been there, I never had to wait to order. The employees are generally nice and quick with making the drinks. You pick up your drink at the same counter that you order your drinks. The only awkward thing is that the menu is on the front counter, so you have to walk up to the front to see the options. \\n\\nAMBIANCE\\nIt is very bright, open, and simple. They have wooden tables and seats with a green fake plant on each table. There are also black and white cutesy paintings on the walls. \\n\\nOVERALL\\nThis is your average boba shop but with better flavor milk teas. I\\'m excited to go back and try the other milk tea flavors and toppings.',\n",

       " \"Not my favorite tea spot in Chinatown. Considering they recently opened and are in a corner area that doesn't get much traffic, I'm surprised they don't have more visible signage to draw in customers. On both visits, I have been the only patron. Service is fast and polite, and the decor is cute. First visit, house milk tea was decent but boba didn't seem fresh. Second visit was the opposite, with the specialty Hokkaido caramel tea being entirely too sweet even when ordering less sweetness, but the boba was just right. I like that the menu offers so much variety, but consistency aside, they're going to need to do some advertising and increase visibility to draw people in if they want to have a fighting chance.\",\n",
       " 'Whenever there\\'s a new boba shop, I\\'m always down to try it!\\n\\nThe grand opening of Ding Tea gave off a fresh vibe. It definitely reminded me of all the popular boba spots in Vegas and California! Their drinks can be very very sweet, so keep in mind! I\\'ve tried the lychee milk tea, winter melon green tea, and the hokkaido oolong milk tea! All were quite good. Their sea salt foam is called \"Cream cheese\" on the menu, in case you\\'re searching for that! I\\'ll probably stop by again to try something new!',\n",

I'm a basic girl so I went with Jasmine Green Tea Latte, less sweet with golden boba. The drink was really good and I could taste the green tea. I also recommend getting less sweet if you're used to the sweetness level at other places. My drink was perfect and the golden boba was chewy in a good way. The golden boba wasn't like honey boba but it was still really good. This shop will definitely be my new hangout place :)\",\n",

He made us feel welcomed the moment we stepped into the store and he made sure our drinks came out the way we wanted them.

I asked if they used any non-dairy creamer or non-dairy option. The girl at the register told me I could have that option, but if I didn't like my drink, then they could not change it for me. Okay...... so I didn't end up taking the risk. Lactose intolerant or vegans, BEWARE!\\n\\nI ended up ordering the pineapple green tea after my whole non-dairy discussion. I got 30% sugar and it was too sweet. They could not adjust it unless I wanted 0%. The flavor itself was decent and there were candied pineapple pieces in the drink, but I could have added more green tea to balance out the sugar. \\n\\nNext, my friend ordered one of their coffee latte drinks (don't remember what it was called). It was too sweet, so he asked for less sugar. His new drink came out, but it was still too sweet. His new drink came out, and it just ended up tasting watered down. When he asked to have the drink changed, the staff seemed confused about how to change the sweetness level.\\n\\nOverall, this place does not seem too accommodating to drink changes, especially if you don't like sweet drinks.

       " \"Wow, I should have came sooner to check this place out because it is definitely one of the better boba places here in the valley. It is located on the same strip mall as Cafe Sanuki and Gyu-kaku, but on the way other side. It's also right in between two closed stores. Plenty of parking and never really a line for milk tea! That's a winning so far in my book. \\n\\nMy one complaint is how drinks differ between plastic medium cups and paper medium cups. Why are some drinks placed in a paper cup and some plastic? I have no idea. \\n\\nAnyways the positives of this place are the drinks are super flavorful even when you opt for 30% sugar. I love places where they offer the less sugar/less ice. It feels much more customizable. So far I have had the signature milk tea (ultimate taste test) and it was phenomenal. Just the right amount of tea and milk. Also had matcha milk tea and they seriously use legit matcha powder. You can see t settle at the bottom, before you shake your drink up. \\n\\nUnique toppings to this place is the golden boba. Basically, regular boba but with the tint of gold. It's not too chewy where you also get a crunch, but just right. And opt for the crystallized boba which has a nice crunch if you like that. It's a bit more than a regular topping at 75cents. \\n\\nI forgot to mention that the drinks are super reasonably priced! I mean $4 for drink and boba is rare to come by in the valley. So that's definitely another plus in my book. \\n\\nI've been definitely choosing this place as my go to even if it means I have to drive 20-30 minutes for it. Why does Chinatown have to be so far from me. Guess it could be a good thing. Otherwise I'd have no money haha\",\n",
       " 'AMAZING BOBA SHOP!!! Very modern decor inside. I was helped out by Cindy and she was great!!

The environment here is cutesy, modern and clean. Not busy especially on one of the busiest holiday ever! (Which is a good thing because of no wait!)\\n\\nI ordered Wintermelon Tea with Fresh Milk with added herbal jelly and egg pudding. It was a little bit watered down. My mom ordered hazelnut coffee and asked if they could bring down the temperature a bit. They were nice to do a small task. And my brother ordered a regular black milk tea. He said it was so-so. I think it's probably because we've tried so much coming from the bay area. But I think this place is pretty good. The staffs are friendly and patient.\\n\\nOverall, my aunt enjoys the interior of this place, It's got a good vibe. The drinks were good, and it wasn't busy so there was no wait. We would come back here to visit when we get the chance.\",\n",

I ordered the chocolate milk tea and honey milk tea. The topping honey boba was good and chewy. The drinks were great. The chocolate, was a little to unsweet even though i asked for extra sweet.\\n\\nI enjoyed their drinks. Hopefully they have a rewards program, or if they offer it they should ask me.

       " 'I have been waiting for Las Vegas\\'s Ding Tea to reopen for the longest time. Ever since Tammy W. mentioned that her favorite boba place was Westminster\\'s Ding Tea, I\\'ve had the place on my radar. Unfortunately, all locations are quite far from the SGV, so having it located close by while I\\'m in Vegas has been amazing (and super convenient!). \\n\\nThe Las Vegas branch was closed for several months due to a fire, but during the reopening, they had several offers which I did partake in. I\\'m a little surprised that every time I visited, the place has always been quite empty. I think Ding Tea truly has one of the best boba and drinks in Vegas - they don\\'t go overly fancy or cater to the IG people. They stay true to the tea and cook boba to perfection, which is what I\\'m always look for in boba/tea. One of the very few places that remind me of boba back in the 626. \\n\\nThe drink menu consists of milk teas, flavored teas, lattes, coffees, juices, hot drinks, etc. Prices are quite affordable (under $5), but with toppings and upgrade, the additional costs do add up. \\n\\nSignature Milk Tea with golden boba: $3.25 plus additional $0.55. I wanted to try their most common drink to give it a test in order to compare to the other boba milk teas that I have tried. I ordered the drink less sweet, but I still thought it was a bit on the sweeter side. Definitely more milk than tea, but the sweetness was not overwhelming and is great for hot days. I also made sure that the golden boba is not the dreaded crystal boba which I am not a fan of. Just a different color, the golden boba was cooked well and super chewy. Recommend ordering this if you\\'re in the mood for something on the sweeter side. \\n\\nJasmine Green Milk Tea: $3.25 - also a bit on the sweeter side despite me ordering it less sweet. Flavor was pretty good and I liked that the taste was natural and kept me wanting more. \\n\\nJasmine Green Tea Latte: $3.45 - while the latte is just made with fresh milk, I still enjoyed this drink quite a bit. For one thing, the green tea was super pure and I could taste the quality of the tea. I really like Hokkaido cream on top, but milk was not too bad. Nothing too special about the latte top except that it adds some sweetness to the tea. \\n\\nI also ordered passion fruit green tea, mango green tea, and lychee green tea for my family on several different occasions. Nobody had anything bad to say about the drink, so I assume they all enjoyed it. \\n\\nPros:\\n-Good boba to tea ratio\\n-No minimum on credit card\\n-Drinks come out fairly quickly\\n-They shake the drinks (hence the \"shake for life\" slogan) mixing the syrup and tea well\\n-Lots of tables/window seats where you can study or chat with friends\\n-Cute interior with aesthetically pleasing furniture/dÃ©cor \\n\\nCons: \\n-I noticed that if you order less sugar, they don\\'t print that on the label. Sometimes the person making the drink is different from the one who took the order. I was confused on whether my drink actually had less sugar. \\n-I did feel a bit rushed the several times I went to the store and was deciding on ordering. \\n\\ntl;dr - Overall, great tasting boba with high quality tea! Highly recommend if you\\'re looking for a drink that won\\'t be too pricey.',\n",
       " \"Drinks are pretty good here ! They're consistent. It's a nice alternative to Kung fu tea house as this place is less of a wait and plenty of parking in plaza. This will be my new go to spot for boba. The passion green tea was too sweet for me so I'll have to remember to order it with 75% less sugar or at least 50% for sure next time. Green milk tea was good. It was different than other jasmine teas I've had but it was still good.\",\n",
       " \"This was one of my bookmarked places and I rly wanted to go in person but instead I postmated it! I see some people rave about this, specifically about the hokkaido mt so I ordered that & my love got the strawberry mt both which golden boba. So my drink tasted really weird, it had a nutty flavor to it which i've never tasted in a hokkaido tea before.... almost like a peanut? It was supposed to be caramel but it wasn't sweet at all (might be my fault though because I ordered 30% sweetness since everyone said it was too sweet prolly should have did 50% maybe? ) On to the boba, it was sort of chewy but also had a harder center which I didn't like. As for my bf he loved his drink, I tried it and it just taste like fresh strawberry tea basically lol it had real strawberries inside and he enjoyed the boba texture/ flavor. All in all, not really sure i'll be back and also my stomach hurts now and it might be related to the drink lol just a heads up\",\n",

       " \"My friends and I tried it out since it was grand opening and BOGO. When we asked for suggestion, they just said everything is good but just get less sweet. I got the Hokkaido milk tea with regular sweet and golden boba. I didn't think it was too sweet. Personally, I didn't like it, but if you like caramel, this drink is for you. The texture of the boba is good but nothing special. My friend got the signature milk tea with less sweet. I think that tasted like water and black tea. The one drink that I thought was ok is the lychee green tea with aloe. If you like lychee, this drink has a really strong lychee flavor and it's not too sweet or too bitter.

It\\'s a nice, noncommittal way of sipping and dipping. There was a bit of a line, but the shop came prepared with employees on deck ready and on top of it.\\n\\nHere are some drinks I tried:\\n\\n-- JASMINE GREEN TEA LATTE: This is my usual. Typically a latte means sea salt cream, but when I asked the employee what their topping was, he simply said it comes like the picture. Okay then... after some more prodding, he said it\\'s their cream cheese topping. It was pretty good, faintly floral. \\n\\n-- MANGO MILK TEA: I\\'ve never really seen this at shops, but decided to try. There really didn\\'t seem to be a \"milky\" factor to it. Tasted kind of like lychee/light mango fruit juice. \\n\\n-- OOLONG MILK TEA: Strong oolong tea taste, but a little too sugary. I\\'d probably get less sweet next time. \\n\\n-- LYCHEE GREEN TEA WITH GOLDEN BOBA: Refreshing, but again a little too sweet. Their boba has sort of a clear color, but I had it the day after so not fair to critique its consistency.',\n",

I asked to sample their strawberry black tea because I've wasted 4 bucks many times over on some crap strawberry black tea. Not tooodaaay-aye. They were kind enough to accommodate my request even though there seemed to be a quick hesitation.

The milk tea was simply divine and perfectly 70% sweet. The boba's consistency is what I envision my dream boba to be - sweet, chewy, and firm.

I ordered: Green Tea Latte, Strawberry Yogurt, Taro Milk Tea and Hazelnut Milk Tea. My green tea latte tasted like water and I ordered it with less ice. I could not taste any Tea, just water and a little sweet from the syrup. As you can see from the picture, their latte style were not what I had at Brew Tea. No sea salt milk foam. They just mixed the Green Tea and Milk, shake it and call it Latte. I was so bummed. Strawberry Yogurt was okay, it was basically strawberry syrup mixed with Yakult yogurt drink. Taro Milk Tea and Hazelnut Milk Tea were also average. I did not taste the sweet honey from their boba and it was too hard and chewy. Compared to Brew Tea it was a complete let down.

The Tokyo Fog was absolutely fantastic, I would definitely recommend trying it if you like vanilla and green tea - it's also very Instagram friendly! Another bonus is that they include one free topping, and the prices are generally cheaper or on par with larger chain bubble tea shops.

       " \"Nohohon is a cute, tiny tea store that specializes in matcha drinks. The menu is rather small, but they do offer lactose-free and sugar-free substitutes. It's not Taiwanese style- it's definitely Japanese, as you can probably tell from the matcha whisks, tatami seats and the small size of the tea room. (Seriously- a lot of Japanese cafÃ©s are the size of a cupboard.)\\n\\nThere's only one barista behind the counter, and if there happens to be one or two more people in front of you, you'll end up waiting for ages for your drink. Exercise patience while chilling in Nohohon! They accept vicinity, ritual, and they often have good deals on Instagram. As well, it's heated up soooo nicely during the winter- you'll feel snug and warm indoors.\\n\\nThe hot drinks taste so good on a cold winter day! However I did not like Furano Field, which was supposed to have lavender in it. They have other lavender drinks as well but I don't recommend them. I did enjoy the Tokyo Fog very much! It's supposed to have vanilla in it, and it's sweet but not overwhelming. I find the prices to be pretty normal for bubble tea joints- usually $5-$6 depending on what toppings you want to get.\\n\\nI would definitely come back to try out their other drinks! And, maybe to try their onigiri? When I was here there was only 1 sad onigiri on the counter.\",\n",
       " \"I love the quality of the drinks they offer here, I know the owner puts in a lot of effort in choosing good quality ingredients. I love that the menu offers healthy choices and not your typical commercialized drinks. Tried their matcha on the rocks and also enjoyed their taro drink as well. Very different from your usual bubble tea shops, can't wait to be back and try more drinks!\",\n",
       " 'I gave Nohohon a second try because the owner had reached out to me after my first experience which was only OK. \\n\\nI tried another drink on their menu instead this time, the Matcha Macchiato which was much better than what I had last time. With no alteration to their own formula, this had the right sweetness for me and the hint of caramel is really good. I added red bean in the topping which complemented the drink very well.\\n\\nService was really good and one of the girls there would run to open the door for you as you leave. She was doing this for as many people as possible! \\n\\nGlad I tried this place again.',\n",

I always use the YELP promo - $1 off drink, so it's definitely a plus.\\n\\nI've only gotten the TARO, but it's totally worth it for me. They told me that each drink has about 1/4 cup real taro and that's hard to come by especially in a world of powders and sugar highs. The taro is already soaked in honey, so I will never add extra sweetener and the texture is smooth, yet real tasting. A major bonus about what I love this place so much is that they have ALMOND MILK. 'Nuff said :)\\n\\nI've been told the fogs and matcha are delicious so I need to try it out if I can get away from my taro love.\\n\\nThey also have other bites that I want to check out, but this place continues to win my heart over every time.\\n\\nKeep up the awesome work!\",\n",

It was a cold rainy day in Toronto (visiting in April) and we were thirsting for some bubble tea. We came across this gem on our search and decided to try it out. I got the traditional milk tea bubble tea... and lemee tell you... it was fantastic! Many places make their bubble tea from powdered (w/o real tea) but not here! You can absolutely taste the difference. Definitely planning on coming back here next time I am in Toronto!',\n",

The first time was when we were early for a game at the Rogers Centre, and the other bubble tea place nearby didn't have good reviews, so we trekked up to Nohohon. It was a longer walk than we had anticipated, but it was well worth it, in my opinion. \\n\\nThey pride themselves on not using the powdered bubble tea mix, and as expected, it is way better. They don't have an extensive menu, but sometimes that's a good thing. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted because everything looked yummy. \\n\\nI ended up going for the fresh taro smoothie with boba. It definitely didn't taste powdered because of the texture. It wasn't overly sweet and unmistakably had the taste of taro. They also have different milk options, which is always a plus for me, as I'm lactose-intolerant. Soy milk all the way, baby.\\n \\nMy boyfriend ended up with an iced Tokyo Fog, and he liked it a lot. On separate second trip, I got the Matcha Latte with soy milk, of course with boba. It was also pretty tasty. \\n\\nIt was pretty hot in the small space when I stopped by both times. I don't know if it was because they were trying to save on the electricity bill, since the temperature was still mild - though it was starting to climb when we were there. \\n\\nI don't think you could really go with anything wrong here. The employees are friendly, and there was never a line when I was here. I wish they had a Nohohon back home - I would be there all the time. \\n\\n\\nOverall: 4/5\\nFood: 4/5\\nService: 4/5\\nAtmosphere: 2/5\",\n",

The service is friendly and the place itself was quite cozy, however I found the drinks to be lacking. There aren't that many seats, and I would imagine that it would get quite cramped when it does get busy. \\n\\nWhen ordering the drink, I was told that if I wanted the cold umeboshi drink I would have to get a large which I did. It was somewhat irritating that I wasn't given the option of getting the smaller size. I got the cold umeboshi drink, the drink tasted really bland. It tasted basically like umeboshi and water. And for the price that I was charged for it, I have to say I was really disappointed by it. My friend got the taro slushie with tapioca and I asked to try it. I found it grainy and overly sweet, I think there are places that does it better.\",\n",

It's either bland or too sweet, but Nohohon gets it just right.\\n\\nThe matcha macchiato was ok, my friend got it and we couldn't really taste the caramel. I don't know if that was intended, but get the Matcha Tokyo Fog...in large, or the biggest size they have.\\n\\nThe staff is really nice too, really helpful and friendly. The only thing that would've made my experience better was if this was a sit-down teashop. But otherwise, great.

There is very limited seating. \\n\\nI had the Tokyo fog, hot. Of course, I made sure to check-in on Yelp ($1 off any drink). Although it wasn't as creamy as I had expected, it was subtly sweet and had a beautiful vanilla aroma. In general, Nohohon teas won't be as sweet as other chain boba shops; they use organic agave and pure cane sugar - according to their instagram, an 80% sweet level at other bubble tea shops is equivalent to Nohohon's extra sweet. \\n\\nTo top off their delicious drinks, the girls that work here are super sweet; if you have any questions about their matchas, they will happily answer you. They'll also explain to you how they freshly grind their matcha to order. However, the true display of Japanese hospitality is how they'll open the door for every customer once they get up to go - I loved that!\",\n",

Mind you, if you're thinking steaming hot as in Chinese tea, you may be disappointed to find your drink on the warm side.  And if you're wondering if they did the hot version wrong?  No absolutely not!  Green teas aren't meant to be steeped with boiling water anyways, as it will destroy the flavor and nutrients.  80C is the best water temp to use!  And I love Nohohon's hot matcha the way it is!  \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with Tokyo Fog which is their best seller!  It's in essence a matcha latte with a hint of vanilla.  I love Furano Field when I have a stressful day at work.  The lavender tasting matcha latte is both soothing and aromatic!\\n\\nTheir red bean topping partners perfectly with any matcha drink.  I like that Nohohon uses larger sized red beans with a nicer texture than what Taiwanese BBT chains like Chatime use.  Drinks aren't too sweet either.

       " \"To call Nohohon a bubble tea shop is a bit inaccurate. A bubble tea shop is like a 20 year old at the club: powdered, pretty, with too many options and often, not enough substance. Nohohon is the more refined older sister, who knows what she's got but doesn't flaunt it with accessories and add-ons. She just beckons you with a genuine smile and quiet disposition. \\n\\nNohohon is a small shop but you can't help but feel a bit more tranquil stepping inside. The people that work there are soft-spoken and polite to the extreme, which is very refreshing compared to places that treat you like a walking wallet. The menu isn't loaded but you know immediately what their specialty is: authentic Japanese green tea. And when I say authentic, I mean it. You can see them mixing up the Matcha with a traditional wooden brush and stone bowl. I've tried two drinks so far:  \\n\\nMatcha Macchiato: A light milky tea drink with hints of caramel. It was definitely different from the heavier black milk teas, but was so refreshing! Like any Macchiato, the tea and the milk were separated very beautifully and mixed together after a couple (many) quick photos. One thing I noticed though was that the Matcha was not very strong, but I think it has to do with the drink being iced and half of the cup being milk. \\n\\nTaro Smoothie: You know how normal taro bubble teas look like someone dropped a bright purple bath bomb in a cup? Nohohon isn't about that. This taro smoothie is a very neutral colour, given that it's made with actual fresh taro pieces. I might have to go back to ordering taro drinks now, but only if they're like this. \\n\\nIt really seems that Nohohon is a tea shop first, bubble tea shop second. Even though this place is out of the way, I'm really looking forward to trying more of their hot drinks and homebrew teas. Yes, you got me. With your peaceful demeanor, lovely attitude, and authenticity, I have to say, I've been thoroughly seduced.\\n\\n(80/100) - 2016\",\n",

They don't use artificial powders or refined sugar and offer dairy alternatives. There's an interesting selection of drinks and several variations on matcha, but yet the menu is not overwhelming and easy to follow. They've mastered the basics (straight matcha) and have also managed to create more unique yummy beverages (hello, Tokyo Fog!). \\n\\nI like that they give you the option to sweeten your matcha with organic agave syrup or pure sugar cane or leave it straight-up. Too many places assume their customers want sweetness a la Starbucks and I love that Nohohon is an exception to this. Sweetened drinks at Nohohon are never overdone and always just right. \\n\\nThey have an amazing staff. If you're a newbie to matcha, I definitely recommend trying out Nohohon for your first matcha experience. From my experience, the staff will be helpful, patient and honest (they're always straight-up in warning that their sweetening is not as heavy-handed as most places). \\n\\nThe location is great - just a few steps west from the 501 Queen streetcar Spadina stop. \\n\\nI took one star off only because the space is so dang tiny and it would be so much better if there were room to linger and hang out. There are only 4 tiny tables currently. The ambience they've got going right now is great --very calm and quiet -- but it is not ideal to be an earshot away from the counter no matter where you are in the space (aka it's hard to have a chat without feeling like your entire conversation is being heard by everyone else in the tea room). \\n\\nIt's also worth noting they sell cute little matcha kits (a perfect gift for matcha-obsessed friends) and whisks if you're into DIY.\",\n",

The menu is laid out very well.  From their different brews, and prices for different sizes, it's so easy to understand the cost of your drink.  The hardest part is choosing! This place feels like a more luxurious version than other tea stores in the area.  The ambiance is really serene.  \\n\\nMy favourite is the Hojicha original brew. I am usually not a fan of taro, because some places make it really sweet and artificial looking, but Nohohon makes it so good with real taro pieces, and with this subtle soft texture. \\n\\nFor those who are lactose intolerant, Nohohon offers a almond soy substitute for $0.50 extra. \\n\\nRemember to use your Vincinity card here, because occasionally we get BOGO deals!\",\n",

The store also sells vegan onigiri and Japanese bottled soda.\\n\\nI had to try the Tokyo Fog, so I got a large, and she informed me that the topping was free! The price came out to around $6, so it's pretty much the same as other bubble teas, if not a little more expensive, but the matcha is hand-whisked in store. The store smells soooo good when she mixes the matcha!\\n\\nHowever, the tapioca in my drink wasn't as soft and chewy as I would have liked. It tasted a little bit undercooked, but the drink was pretty good. I think I may try something else that has more matcha in it next time. The matcha in the Tokyo Fog wasn't strong enough for me.\\n\\nOther than that, I really like this place! Not to mention, there are a lot of opportunities to save money here! For the Vicinity points card, you only have to get 3 points to upsize your drink for free, and if you check in on Yelp, you get $1 off! SCORE. I even got a text after my first visit, saying I could claim a BOGO drink!\\n\\nI saw a picture on the website where you got BOGO when you came in with Blue Jay's apparel during the World Series.

The menu was a little vague so I had to ask for clarification with regards to what was in each of their drinks. Nohohon doesn't really have anything unique about it- I'm not sure if their 'Japaneseness' is enough to get patrons to come in. Talking to the employees, the owner's vision is to have  a shop that sells healthier bubble tea ... All the drinks don't seem to be healthy as they all have sugar, honey and cream.

Nohohon has a very different approach when mixing and making their drinks. They use more natural mixtures of tea's and ingredients. I got the Tokyo Fog and it's green tea with vanilla and red bean as an extra topping. I was thinking that it would taste very vanilla like or a shot sorta.. but it actually didn't, and when shaken well the green tea flavor tastes very smooth and not too creamy. The red beans is probably by far the tastiest i've ever had in a drink in a long time. They were brewed very well, because I thought it would be a bit soft and soggy after being left in the drink for a while but it didn't turn out that way at all. It was still chewy and non mushy (if that's a good way to put it?)\\n\\nThe workers at the place are also very friendly as well.

The matcha was of good quality, but I didn't taste too much of the hazelnut (I don't mind, I mainly wanted matcha with just a HINT of other flavouring). I loved that a topping was free and got red bean. This red bean was not soaked in sugar so don't expect it to be super sweet! \\n\\nTL;DR if you're looking for a drink with no BS fake powders & not sickly sugary with the addition of dairy-free alternatives (hey vegans!)... Nohohon Tea should be on your try list.\",\n",

We decided to play it safe and went with the Matcha Latte (needed a caffeine boost after a LONG work week) and the Latte did not disappoint.  Very strong matcha flavour and was balanced well with the Latte flavour.  I want to point out Nohohon is not your typical bubble tea place, they do not use powders for their drinks flavouring and instead tea are brewed fresh from ingredients from Japan!  Decoration is very impressive, detailed and gives a good traditional Japanese vibe!  Nana also hand picked a beautiful tatami (aka mat) close to the window for customers to sit and relax.  I had a really great time enjoying a great latte while catching up with a friend!

Fair. \\n\\nI stopped by yesterday around noon to pick one up, and was told that the onigiri was being delivered within the half hour, which put a damper my lunch plans. I ran some errands and went grocery shopping which took me to 1:30pm, and stopped by again on the way home.

It is quite thirst quenching and not as sweet as it sounds in a good way! The teas are brewed. I believe there are a few options for the toppings, like red bean (which was also good). I have also tried the Original Brew and Vanilla Brew. I wasn't a big fan of the Original Brew as I found it a little bit diluted.\\n\\nThe space inside the tearoom is a little compact although the interior ornaments are very cute and gives off a zen atmosphere.

This, along with the fact that this place prefers to steep and use more natural ingredients rather than colourful powders, made the wait longer than your usual tea shop.\\n\\nAll of the drinks are made with almond milk or soy milk, and things like agave and real taro. The result is a very toned down, more natural tasting drink. The regular sugar level is really not that high at all compared to other places, and you can adjust the sugar level. I only wish there was a dairy option, as almond milk and soy milk are a lot less rich and impart a thinner, different flavour, however I suspect that this place may be striving to be gluten-free vegan, so that may be why. \\n\\nI ordered a fresh taro smoothie and my boyfriend got their regular matcha latte, hot. Unfortunately, they were out of boba at the time. The taro smoothie was unlike any other taro sweet I've had, and that is because it was made with actual taro. There were no strong flavours, no bright purple colour, just a thick and lightly sweet smoothie. The matcha latte tasted a little thinner and not as rich as I was used to. There was also a distinct lack of bitterness for some reason.\\n\\nI am giving this place 4 stars because it is a nice atmosphere, and I like the concept. I feel a lot of people who want to enjoy a healthier treat will like this place. Personally, I prefer the stronger tastes of the less natural versions, but for anyone who complains about drinks being too sweet these days this is the place for you.\",\n",

Although the customer service can improve if your in the mood for a delicious cold or hot drink then stop by! The prices are fair game as well! They had some fun facts about Tapioca Pearls that I snapped a photo of! \\n\\nThe boba is prepared just right not soggy or extra slimy!\",\n",
       " \"Who loves bubble tea?! If you answered you then you're awesome! If you answered me you're right! I do. I knew this place was opening and since I'm a bobaholic why the heck not?!\\n\\nI had a busy day at work last week and decided a bubble tea might make my day a little better and I stopped by on my lunch. Bad Idea. Short ribs took a while to prepare. I guess that's a good thing they were piping hot and succulent. Could have been slightly more tender but for a bubble tea place not bad at all. The garlic rice wasn't very garlicky. Which is funny because the manager asked if I wanted garlic rice and I said ok! Then he says its a really good garlic rice. He lied :/. \\n\\nThe milk tea I ordered came with the combo I ordered a regular and they gave me a large. They charged me wrong and undercharged me and I told the cashier and they said not to worry about it because they couldn't figure out how to do it in their new registers as the place had only been open a few days. \\n\\nThe royal milk tea itself was pretty good. Not my favorite I've had but not bad. The boba was the standard soft slightly mushy boba you find pretty much everywhere besides KFT. I love KFT but no one makes their boba like them. I think everyone should get in on the secret because it has amazing texture and flavor. \\n\\nService was great here the first time. Second time it was ok. Not as good as the first time. My second visit I came today and we ordered a Thai tea and a taro slush without boba. The Thai tea tasted too strong and was undrinkable IMO. The taro slush was pretty good but again I think KFT is killing the boba and taro slush game. Overall this is an ok option if you're not willing to drive all the way to Chinatown.  I can see this place as a chill spot to study or chill with drinks and grab a drink. Just steer clear of the Thai tea.\",\n",
       " \"This place is pretty good! It was the first place I was exposed to Boba, and has been pretty consistently my go to place for a good one. The yogurt frost is amazing! \\n\\nI will say, their employees are generally not super friendly, or maybe they're just stand offish? I'm not really sure. They make a great boba though, and that's the only thing I come here for!\",\n",
       " \"Came here at 10 and it's closed... I don't know if this is Yelp's fault or the business's fault, but disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"I was out and about and after spending the previous day looking at Boba tea joints on yelp, I did a quick search and decided to pay TE a visit.  We came in right before lunch time.  There was no one present and this allowed us time to check out the menu.  Oh how I wanted fries....but given I had brought my lunch to work, I did not want to ruin my appetite nor my lunch.  The lady behind the counter was friendly enough in explaining this and that.  I settled on the Melon Milk Boba Tea.  I watched as it was prepared with ease and the top of the cup was sealed with a layer of plastic in nifty fashion.  The first sip was cool, sweet and refreshing.  Remember...as your cup says....chew your Boba balls and don't swallow!!\",\n",
       " 'this place is the best! they also use fresh fruits. I always get the avocado boba. I live in the West side and go all the way here to get the avocado boba. their sisig fries or with rice is the best! I just wish they have more locations. MORE LOCATIONS',\n",

I come here just for the spicy chicken.\",\n",
       " \"Was not happy with my experience today. I drove all the way there to get boba on this hot day and some snacks, but was not able to get them.

       " \"Awesome place but I can't say it's the best in Las Vegas. The only thing I like about this place is the option of having egg pudding & small tapioca. However, when adding egg pudding you can't adjust the sweetness. When I ordered a regular milk tea with the egg pudding, it was just like sipping through a bland/no flavor pudding. Since I've tried other drinks like the honeydew- it's good! Saw them make it with fresh cut but frozen melon. \\n\\nIf ordering any food here like their small 3pcs of taro bun, just go to Seafood City and you can get about 6-9pcs for the same price. I have not yet tried any other snacks they offer but I'm scared to due to portion and unreasonable prices.\\n\\nStill earn my 4 stars for having a delicious boba though. Enough for me to come back when I can. I know that the store is still new but I believe they'll make progress.\",\n",

They suggest good stuff too and now my favorite that I'm always craving is the chocolate bubble! TapEx also has this thing where you can do a drink upgrade, for cheap! Awesome.

I couldn't even finish a small because of how overwhelming the taste was. I ordered the passion fruit boba and it was as if they had just dumped the whole container of passion fruit flavoring into the drink. There was no balance in the drink. Not my first option for a drink of this kind. Do not go, I can think of many of other places better than this.\",\n",
       " 'So ive been here a few times now and the greatest thing about this place is the boba and the different toppings.. i love that they have small size boba but the only thing is that the smoothies and drinks are inconsistent it just depends on who is making them which is the reason this place is not on the top of my list. I will leave this review on a good note and say that they have Sisig Fries ( crispy pork belly fries) which are pretty good they are topped with cheese, sour cream, crispy pork belly and an egg on top.',\n",
       " 'My BF and I stopped here just to get a boba drink, but we ended up eating here. It was delicious!!! The owner gave us free crispy chicken and heck, it was so good we decided to eat here. On top of that, ordered crispy chicken again (rice) and sisig rice as well :) The food was not oily at all, for it to be fried. The place was clean, the workers were nice, and the food was delicious!! Definitely deserves 5 stars!!!',\n",
       " \"Huh.. never had a bubble tea I didn't like.. until today that is. I had a chance to try both the honey and the almond milk tea. They both tasted strongly of pre-made mix and not fresh at all, mind you I wouldn't count myself as overly picky either. Perhaps in the past this was the best you could get around here, but there are much better options within ~5 minutes of this place, and a metric ton of options if you're willing to go a little further into Chinatown. I did not try any snacks or food here so I can't comment on that. \\n\\nTo their credit I did find the boba to be a nice consistency (soft but not soggy) and the people working there were polite and helpful.\",\n",
       " \"I love tapex. Moved here from San Diego and I was super excited to have one here. What I don't like is that they're short staffed. Waited almost 20 mins for two drinks..... That's horrible a super slow service because they're so short staffed.\",\n",

This Tapioca Express left a lot to be desired.\\n\\nMy normal go to snack at Tapioca Express is the crispy chicken with fried basil...this location indicated that they don't make theirs with basil...that was a huge bummer! Then adding insult to injury they sugared my hot jasmine tea! \\n\\nAll in all, this was closer to yucky than yummy\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m pretty familiar with TapEx back in my hometown so I was excited to see this place open up so close to me! \\n\\nBut this franchise, like most people mentioned, isn\\'t quite similar to its Californian counterparts. They offer similar drinks but they cater to more of Filipino food aficionados, compared to the Taiwanese snacks that are found elsewhere. With longanisa fries and sisig, I\\'m not complaining. \\n\\nThe drinks are not bad but not that great. I like being able to taste the tea in my milk tea but unfortunately of the drinks I\\'ve tried, they\\'re either too milky or watered down. HOWEVER, I do recommend asking for your milk tea to be \"blended.\" Basically where they ice blend your milk tea into sort of a smoothie. It tastes great and it\\'s the easiest way to cool you down on a hot day! \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s OooOoookay. Would probably come back just because of the space they offer to do work.',\n",

Would recommend this place for sure!\",\n",
       " 'We had a midday snack Saturday 03/07/15. I had the red bean frosti milk with pudding and boba. I have to say I enjoyed it. It was very tasty. I did not mix the drink at first so I got all boba and pudding. Very tasty, so I started mixing and it was red bean, pudding and boba all together. It tasted even better. Service was great. The longanisa fries were very good but I was stuffed after a couple bites.',\n",
       " \"Was craving some boba after lunch so we checked the place out. Went with the jasmine milk tea with light boba and it was really sweet. The drink itself didn't blend too well. You couldn't really taste too much jasmine since the sugar overpowered everything. \\nThe boba wasn't the best I've tried, BUT it wasn't terrible. The boba throughout was consistent, but not that (freshly cooked boba) chewy. The price was fair and not overpriced. \\nCouldn't dock too many stars since Jasmine Milk Tea was the only thing I tried, but I definitely won't try this place again...\\nThe place itself was spacious and the service was quick.\",\n",
       " \"Tapioca Express reminds me of my youth. Back in 2002 my love affair with boba drinks began. In Cali, TapEx was thee shhhhhit. Pretty much the gold standard for boba drinks at the time. That was the life, listening to Beyonce's crazy in love, sippin' on some boba, chatting on AIM, while downloading illegal music...and no adult responsibilities. \\n\\nAnywho, Vegas finally has TapEx as of last year?! Still the same! In a good way. It's a solid chain. Can't complain. Service is always so-so. \\n\\nTapEx is still cool because they are the only ones in town that have hazelnut snow bubble, mini boba, and decent spicy popcorn chicken! \\n\\nThe overall space inside is great. For a boba shop, plenty of seating! \\n\\nWho is in the mood for a sugar high? TapEx advertises drink specials like: green tea kit kat, ferrero rocher, and tareo (taro+oreo?!). TapEx also offers more food items than other places, including some Filipino inspired dishes. \\n\\nSide notes: \\n- I only order two things: caramel or hazelnut snow bubble. Same thing forever. It's good and comforting. Not mind blowing.\\n\\n- I have tried: earl grey milk tea. Not impressed. Actually, I dislike their milk teas here. \\n\\nThis is one of those places that I don't make a special trip for. That means only if I am in the area shopping for Asian groceries lol.\",\n",
       " 'Went in on a Monday afternoon around 1:00 pm. It was my first time going so I was undecided as what to get, I recently have become obsessed with boba, so I was super excited to try tapioca express. Bonus points that it is in walking distance of where I live. I entered the restaurant and was warmly greeted by a girl working the counter. I decided to try something relatively plain, so I got the jade green milk tea with boba and I also tried the spicy buffalo chicken fries. As soon as I got home I tore into my bag because the fries smelled sooooo delicious. The fries were crisp and delicious, the chicken had a little bit of gristle, but overall very good. As for the tea, that was very good as well, the boba was cooked perfectly, not to chewy but not hard either. Definitely will he going back.',\n",
       " \"I don't mind boba/bubble tea but since it's often laden with sugar I tend to stay away from it.  Tapioca Express isn't bad at all, it is a different boba from the norm.\\n\\nWhat I like about Tapioca Express is not only do you have drinks, but they have a selective menu of finger foods too!  Almost like a little bistro type atmosphere.  But honestly we stopped by here after a HUGE meal in Seafood City consisting of goodies from Grill City & Crispy Town.  I was already stuffed!  But the kid wanted a sweet drink to wash it all down.  Nothing like spending $5 on copious amounts of sugar water!  Oh, and tapioca balls.\\n\\nI'll give them this, their boba is smaller in size that just about all other places, making it much easier to drink through a smaller straw.  But I dunno, I'm just not all that into boba anymore!  I've done enough tapioca ball chewin' to gain myself like 5 pounds back then.  I drop all that sugar & starch...I drop weight.  Plus I'm not on a sugar high!  I just go back to sugar-free Red Bull or Monster when I have to ha ha ha!\\n\\nI don't remember what flavor boba smoothie we got, but I'm pretty sure one of the flavors was ube.  We halved it with another flavor.  I took a few sips.  Smoothie had good consistency, almost like a Slurpee & the boba was chewy but not too chewy.  Kid liked it, I thought it was OK.  Nothing I'm gonna drive all the way across town for.  Like spending money on some hipster drinks?  Go to Tapioca Express!  Yes...at the time there were also hipsters hanging out.\\n\\nBut I may have to go back to try some of the food on their menu, looks tasty!  Boy do I have a hard time resisting them croquettes...\\n\\n#bobalife\",\n",
       " \"Great to finally have a Tapioca Express outside of California. I have had it a few times and happy they opened up a location in Las Vegas. To add to that a good boba place on the east side of town! I came in on Monday night and there were a few patrons, I usually don't get too adventurous but how risky can you get considering it's a boba place? I must add though I hate when I try something out of the norm and am not satisfied. So I went ahead and order the hazelnut snow because I wanted it ice blended. Mmm, mmm! It sure was delicious. I'm glad they were able to execute the good taste of the drink just like California locations do. I notice when something is popular in California and then comes to Vegas it is just not as good. Thankfully this Tapioca Express did not disappoint! Their POS card system was not working that night and I only had my card on me so it left them no choice but to give me the drink on the house. I was certainly thankful for that and a reason I am writing them a review. Since the POS card system wasn't working the service was a tad bit slow, but I could tell the employees were doing what they could to get through their processes faster. The inside is of course new, which nice clean and somewhat modern touches. Tapioca Express is definitely my new boba spot in town!\",\n",

Therefore , it's best if you order the drinks separately if you happen to be on a date and your guy friend insisting paying for you .. Kinda ruin the mood ...  And don't go to her store and hour or two before she closes ... She probably won't have any tapioca balls left by then .. So make sure you call ahead of time to ensure that she have boba left and if she says she's saving it for you , don't expect there are gonna be a good amount of portion of boba cause I got half amount of boba and got charged at the same price ..

So she got her first drink and then said she didn't like it. The boss lady decided to just make her a new drink, which was nice of her since it was the girl's choice to get that drink. \\n\\nOverall good boba! I personally love the Taro House Special. SUPER DELICIOUSSSS! Give it a try!\",\n",
       " \"this is the best boba place in phoenix. hands down. \\nand in CA, it would probably be a 3 1/2-4, so overall, it's good. \\n\\nTotally recommend the house special. It's a slushy drink (not sure if it's milk tea, bc it tastes not very tea-ish) with boba, pudding, and grass jelly, and i think caramel? or maybe that's from the boba syrup. Either way, it's a great classic combo, and it's about $5. \\n\\nworth the occasional drive out west... but would LOVE if they had a location in central phoenix!!!!!\",\n",
       " 'Legit boba and really good snow. I always get chocolate slush, here it really tastes like chocolate rich and chocolates.',\n",
       " \"2nd time here and noticed they got rid of the multiple options for yogurt and now have something called snow fluff in fruit flavors and can fruit for toppings. The owner explained it's not as sweet as yogurt so it might appeal to adults with a not so sweet tooth. They did not have samples yet but look forward to the it soon. Still great and friendly service like my last time here.\",\n",
       " \"I come here often and have always had a great experience! I've been trying different options of smoothies they have and so far I really like the avocado smoothie with boba, the taro with babe or the coconut, absolutely delicious. I would recommend them to anyone, very satisfied\",\n",
       " 'Went here for the first time today and loved it! Awesome tea options and delicious goji berry flavors. It is definite my new go-to for boba tea!',\n",
       " 'Been to a few boba places and this one is my second favorite one. The boba is cooked very well not over done or ever old and the little Asian couple that owns it are so sweet. The only thing is it took a little longer for the drinks to come out, they probably should hire some people instead of just them and the drinks were very sweet almost too much that it made me sick if I drank it all other than that everything was good',\n",
       " \"Out of town, decided to meet my Az friend here due to the 5 star reviews. My friend wanted to sample their froyo, the cashier told us they ran out of sample cups.  I then suggested to try it on a spoon, she said they were short on spoons. Point being, there was no way to sample the froyo  Wth?  We ended up getting the shaved mango snow, it was decent. Unfortunately, I won't be coming back to this establishment when I come to Az. It was not a good experience for me and my friend.  I don't feel she was apologetic.\",\n",
       " \"HOUSE SPECIAL\\n\\nI was skeptical as I don't always like boba (it's filling) and don't usually like grass jelly (in which this has both). It's an ice milk drink with the formerly mentioned and pudding. This may sound overwhelming if you haven't had boba type drinks before, but they are all perfect compliments of each other. \\n\\nOther things I've tried:\\n* Avocado smoothie - made with real avocado - added grass jelly. It was good that they used fresh avocado and if you like Avocado - try it!\\n* Vietnamese coffee - super sweet, but a great viet coffee. You have to let the ice melt a bit but it's strong and good for a coffee fix / coffee lover.\\n* Pina colada slush - sweet but you definitely pick up each flavor - pineapple, cocounut. Good for when you're craving tropical.\\n* Volcano Green Tea - believe this is peach green tea (I get less sweet) and has fresh strawberry and pineapple pieces and green apple jelly (I typically get without jelly sometimes).  \\n\\nYes, the service can be slow - especially on the weekend. But if you simply go in expecting this, then you won't be hangry or surprised. Why is it slow? They make to order and the do small batches of boba so that each boba is the perfect texture. When you large batch boba it comes out hard in the middle or overly mushy. So I for one appreciate the dedication to quality. If they can figure out a way to make more small batches quickly and have on hand / speed up the back of house logistics then awesome. But I'll still come here because the service is good because the owner is a sweet lady and serves quality stuff.\",\n",
       " \"Today was my first time coming here and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place for some good boba! I was greeted by this cute lady I think she's the owner here, she was really sweet! I didn't wait for long for my drink to come out, and plus I didn't have to get out of my seat to get my drink! It was brought to me at my table! The service here was great! And the drink was awesome! Compared to another boba place I use to go to, I will now come here from now on! Worth my drive and money.\",\n",
       " 'Staff was very polite about my friends and I showing up too early and we came back again later. Drank boba. Played Jenga with friends. 10/10 would tapioca again.',\n",

       " \"3rd or fourth time here they now have the flavored snow fluff. The owner Louise is always friendly and informative every time we come here. Enjoyed the variety of toppings they have especially for the new snow fluff. They now sell a variety of locally baked macaroons on the weekend. And occasionally the really hard to find green tea kit kats. Sometimes they run out of boba because they make fresh batches. If they run out try one of the puddings instead. It's still great in your smoothie.\",\n",
       " \"My first time going here to see what all the hype is about on the House Special. I went with a few friends and my boyfriend. This was my first and only visit so far and I just tried their House Special. You can sit in the store or outside. It's not that big and I could compare it similar size to a Yogurtland. As everyone told me, the wait sometimes is too long and to my experience, I say it true. It took about 5-7 minutes and I was fine with that because I am a pretty reasonable and patient person. There was only 1 person working... Back to the drink, I enjoyed it very much. The House Special drink is very good & definitely worth a try. I am filipino and the way I could describe this drink is that it is like a cold taho. I gulped it down because it was too good!! I still need to try more drinks but I have a strong feeling that I will just come back for the House Special.\",\n",

Those are the BEST! :) I love the pudding and jelly in there! It makes the drinks so fun! They recently came out with a taro house special! Lol when I heard about it I was like I have to go get some!!! I did and it was so DELISH!! \\n\\nMy other favorite one is the Volcano Drink. It's really really good! There like little star jelly in it! It's so cute!\\n\\nThey recently added green tea latte! It's is mmmmMm YUMMY! Love it! You can also create your own drinks too. \\n\\nWhen it's crowded it would take awhile to get our drinks because they make it all fresh! So I don't mine the wait at all. They have like games for us to play with. \\n\\nThe owner is absolutely lovely! I love her! She is super friendly. Very welcoming.\",\n",
       " \"Love the tea/boba/fruit drinks here!!!  I've already gone twice in two days since discovering they were open.  They serve my all-time favorite boba drink, a Thai milk tea.  So good!  I tried my husband's lychee slush with mango jelly mixed in, and it was delicious too.  They offer a wide selection of different fruit teas, milk teas, and slushes.  For about 40 cents more you can add in boba (tapioca pearls), different flavors of cubed fruit jelly, or fresh fruit.  Of course, they are also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop.  I have not tried the yogurt, but the selection of toppings was good and looked fresh.\\n\\nThe shop is clean with tables both inside and out.  The lady at the counter, who I believe is the owner, is friendly.  I'm a fan of this place, and will be back at least once a week to get my Thai tea.  Highly recommended!\",\n",

AND macaroons (frozen, so youll have to wait about 10-15 minutes for them to thaw).\\n\\nI ordered the original shaved ice, with mochi and almond slivers with a condensed milk glaze. Firstly, it looked adorable. It was light and fluffy and oh so very refreshing. \\n\\nI also ordered 5 macaroons. Theyre still thawing out so I cant comment on the taste/texture yet.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the strawberry shaved ice with fresh strawberries and almond slivers. Also with the condensed milk glaze. Again, light and fluffy, not over powering at all. All around perfection.\\n\\nCertainly will make this place a staple in our lives. This place is a must.',\n",

I liked the boba because it was easier to pop then some others that I have tried. I also tried the mocha with regular boba and the tea was really good but the boba was hard to eat although the place isn't to blame for that. Good service. Nice people, fun atmosphere. Would go again and we're planning on bringing friends :)\",\n",

Friendly and speedy service, bonuses and kudos deserved! \\n\\nI tried my drink and immediately loved it, it was sweet but it didn't take over, I was still able to taste the milk tea, the pudding, the grass jelly and the boba. The pudding and boba were quite nicely flavored too! I want to say the boba was honey flavored, and soft. The grass jelly and pudding were extra cool and refreshing. \\n\\nI want to say that out drinks came out to be about $5.15-$5.25 as our order of 5 drinks came out to about $25 and some change. A great price for how much they give. \\n\\nYo&I, although you're far from my residence but you've found yourself a regular!\",\n",
       " \"I go in for their milk teas mostly, which reminds me of tapioca express. Recently had their pina colada slush and mango slush (tropical?) both were yummy. They opened brand new this month so they're still working out the kinks. Take advantage of their BOGO sale!\",\n",
       " \"Nice..I finally found a boba shop by my house. I haven't had boba in a long time, well since visiting  National City near SD.  When I walked into yo&I I scan the menu and decided on a avocado smoothie with boba.  Came out shortly and was really good. I love eating boba in my smoothies. The avocado smoothie tasted great.

Their menu includes several other items besides frozen yogurt like boba tea, flavored tea, and shakes. Their fro-yo selection, therefore, isn't extensive like the big chains but what they do have is tasty and I'd personally have a few things that taste great than a smorgasbord of meh. The lady at the front (Louise or Eloise?) is very sweet. You can tell she takes great pride in her store and enjoys having customers. As a huge boba fan, I will have to try that next and I'm hoping it's as enjoyable as the fro-yo I had on this visit!\",\n",

       " \"I was shopping all around phoenix today and was in area, wanting  to try some place new for my boba fix I decided to stop by and try this place out after hearing from friends that this place was new and pretty good if not better in comparison to Bomboba, i've frequent bomboba quite a bit so I was skeptical - I needed to see and taste for myself before judging; so this was a good time and definitely wanted to come try the ice milk drink after seeing the picture folks uploaded! \\n\\nFirst impression walking up to the shop is that was a nice little yogurt shop, once inside it was very clean, bright, and modern. I noticed the wall menu of drinks wasn't all cluttered to make you feel like you need to read through paragraph to see what you'd want and what you're looking for to see if it's available - simple and easy to read! \\n\\nAfter briefly looking through the drink menu, I walked up to the nice asian lady in the front which turned out to be one of the owners and she was very kind and helpful and  told me quite a bit of the place, which made me appreciate this couples owned shop. \\n\\nI've ordered the Ice milk drink that I've heard so much about and seen in pictures, which is very delicious! It came in a big container cup as comparable to purplekow's cup out in SF - I love it, next time I will probably ask to make it a tad bit sweeter; but this is definitely one of my new favorite boba drinks in AZ! \\n\\nTo describe the tastes, it's a very light sweet cream milk slush with boba and grass jelly but I added pudding for an extra 39 cents and it's well worth it and added another level of sweetness :) \\n\\nThe other drinks I've got tonight was their Boba Milk Tea, Pina Colada Slush w/ popping boba,  and Berry Slush w/ popping boba!\\n\\nBoba Milk Tea, very subtle and not over powering - just about right in comparison to most other places.\\n\\nPina Colada Slush w/ mango & lychee popping boba, pretty good solid and easily recognizable universal taste and was perfect with my added toppings. \\n\\nBerry Slush w/ lychee popping boba, very good in terms of a berry slush - the strong tone of berry flavor would be a rasberry/blue berry flavoring and the lychee popping boba balanced it out for my tastes :)\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend boba lovers to try this place out for themselves if you're seeking something and some place new if you've frequent other boba shops; the yogurt I've sampled were very delicious and flavorful too!  i'm not really into yogurt but the banana cream pie was very very good!

This tea is definitely refreshing, fruity and comes with bits of jelly, strawberry and pineapple.\\n\\nThe service is always nice, the lady is so sweet and ensures the drinks come out right.

If that isn't enough, try their shaved snow too. Good place to visit for a nice cold beverage on a hot summer day or just any day.

I dislike when boba is overcooked and mushy, flavorless or raw in the middle for obvious reasons.\\n\\nReally slow service here, but understandable as it's one lovely lady working the cashier and her husband (?) in the back making drinks. The woman was so friendly and kind, she also brought out the drinks and apologized for the wait which I didn't mind at all. The prices aren't too bad at all and the quality is great. I also saw that they have french macarons here that I will have to try when they aren't out.\",\n",

The House Special is amazing! I returned another time to try my usual bubble tea order (pineapple/green apple with boba) and that was also excellent. There are only a few places in this universe where I will even consider trying something else on the menu when I already know I like something, but this is one of them!

Mr. W. once surprised me after work with a House Special and it was an explosion of flavors.  Between the pudding, boba, grass jelly, and milk tea, I was on a roller coaster of textures and flavors and I can only sum it up in one word:  Sweetness.  I went into the shop yesterday and got the same thing and it was still a crazy whirlwind of flavors and textures.  The boba is soft and cooked well and the pudding just melts in your mouth so that's always a plus.\\n\\nThe targeted audience seems to be teenagers and young adults.  It's a clean shop with lots of other goodies and sweets to offer.  Service is good, prices are reasonable, and it's definitely not a bad place to check out if you're in the west valley!

They are also known for their house special but if you decide to get the house special make sure to mix it up really well or else you'll just taste ice and boba. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I would come here more than the other boba place.

The condensed milk made it sweet and the egg pudding was good. I didn't like the lychee jelly as it was sweet and syrupy (but my friend chose that topping). Good price point for a dessert to share.\\n\\nThe owners are always so nice and apologetic for the time the drinks/desserts come out, but hey they put out good product!

It's an interesting combination involving mango pudding, grassy jelly, boba and various smoothie flavor. Their slushes are rainbow colorful. If you are not familiar with Asian foods I suggest keeping an open mind and after a couple of visits you will find yourself a favorite drink or dessert.

I thought she misunderstood what I meant, but while I was eating it, she came over and told me that she forgot to add the chocolate chips inside the bubbles when she was making it so she just put it on top. \"Hope that\\'s okay.\" No.... that\\'s not okay. If you misunderstood, that\\'s one thing. I can forgive that. But, if you made a mistake, you should\\'ve corrected it. Throwing chocolate chips on top is NOT the equivalent of melting them inside. It\\'s like putting chocolate chips on top of a plain cookie when someone asked for a chocolate chip cookie. NOT THE SAME!

       " \"Not terrible (as in, still better than some boba places) but definitely the worst Tapioca Express I have been to. I love TapEx in the Bay Area, and I used to go every week for boba and crispy calamari. The location here, while still providing solid tapioca pearls, fell short in customer service, efficiency, and final product. Really, the boba is the only reason to return.\\n\\nOverall, they definitely still have some kinks to work out. They were unable to answer questions about their menu and told me they had no soy milk and could not add soy or milk to the tea I ordered; behind me, a customer with a diary allergy ordered a drink with soy. When her drink came, the employee said she didn't know what was in it and continued to tell me they didn't have soy. When someone has an allergy, this is just unsafe. \\nUltimately, it came down to her saying that they did have soy, but she refused to make mine with soy milk because she didn't think it would taste good. This, to me, seems ridiculous. \\nReally, they retain their three stars because the boba was still delicious- chewy, flavorful, and good to the end of the drink. However, the crispy calamari took about 4-5 times longer than they said it would to make and instead of the flavorful, crispy batter I have grown to love at other locations, this had a heavy overcooked crunch. Knowing how good the product at other TapEx locations is, this was quite disappointing.\",\n",

What happened to customer is always right? (LOL) I mean, I've been to many other boba spots and they've messed up a few times,& I would ask to get a new one made, & they would. Obviously if I'm paying for an almost $5 drink, wouldn't you think I'd want it made the right way? DUH. Whatever, other than that, I guess the  crispy chicken makes up for it.\",\n",

She explained to me that what makes them stand out is that they have two sizes of bobas. They have the smaller size \"pearls\" which a regular straw would accomadate and the bigger (more common) \"pearls\", in which the fat straws are needed. \\n\\nI decided to go with the bigger size boba since the smaller ones were not availble at the time.  I\\'m guessing it was because I came right when they opened so maybe they didn\\'t get to make it yet? Nonetheless, I went with the taro flavor in the larger of the two sizes they offer. \\n\\nOrder came up fast and I was on my way eager to see if I found a new spot for boba with my friend. The flavor of taro was very artificial and powdery. The drink was cloyingly sweet-even for me who would be Mayor of Sugar City if they had an election.

Nohohon Tea Room can be so busy at times with more than a handful of people waiting in line to order and waiting for their drinks.\\n\\nDrinks are hit and miss, at least with the ones I tried. \\n\\nTokyo Fog with Red Bean (Cold) - a tradtional combination which is really good,\\nMatcha Latte (Hot) - taste was balance and you can really taste the matcha \\nForano Field (Hot) - Skip! More like a waterdown milk with water, matcha/lavender both MIA\\nMatcha Caramel with Glass Jello (Cold) - Meh, \\n\\nI might try some other more matcha intensive drink next time: Hot Matcha Straight. And some other Yuzu drinks which should be quite refreshing.\\n\\nMake sure you use your Vicinity Card to collect rewards points to redeem for free offers and drinks.\\n\\nThe owner and staff here are all so friendly and cheerful. True Japanese hospitality!\",\n",
       " \"A cute little tea shop tucked near the corner of Queen and Spadina. I heard lots about their specialty in matcha flavoured drinks and as a huge fan of matcha I just had to try! \\n\\nOrdered the large iced Tokyo Fog with grass jelly using the $1 off Yelp coupon. Before the coupon its $5.50 + tax. The matcha flavour is distinct and not too sweet. The grass jelly was in blobs which is what I prefer but it wasnt as soft as chatime's. \\n\\nThe lady at the cash was very friendly! Overall, this place is great, authentic and definitely worth a try if you are in the area.\",\n",
       " 'Came here in a weekday afternoon. I was a bit hungry so I ordered one onigiri and a drink for myself. \\nThe onigiri is a bit pricy compare to the other Japanese restaurant. I find the drink is more compelling. I was overwhelmed by the lavender brew tea that written on the menu once I got into the store and it becomes one of my favourites now. It is a healthier version of milk tea or bubble tea. If I am around the area, I would definitely coming back to try out the other drinks.',\n",
       " \"Their official name is Nohohon Tea Room and...it's literally the size of a room.\\nThe interior is nicely decorated and gives you the whole japanese tea house feel. They also share a washroom with the ajisai AYCE next door, so you're getting the luxury service there. \\n\\nThere's a tatami mat up front where you can sit if that is your preference. Otherwise, there are wooden chairs available if you would rather not feel like an emperor.\\n\\nIt's a japanese themed tea house so you have options like matcha milk tea, houjicha milk tea, yuzu lemonade, taro smoothies, or momo oolong. They also provide hot pots of teas if you're feeling less sugary.\\n\\nBubble Teas come in small, medium, or large cups, with soy or almond milk, as well as one free topping (tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean). You can also customize the sugar or ice levels, but you'll have to take some initiative there. I didn't think about it and ended up with ice in my drink. The price is about the same as other tea places, if you include that one free topping.\\n\\nVicinity is accepted if you use that rewards program (you might as well, since most tea places offer it).\\n\\nThere is usually only one or two people working behind the counter so if there are others in line already prepare to wait a few minutes.\\n\\nI ordered the green haze with almond milk and tapioca, which is a matcha latte with hints of hazelnut flavour. The drink was enjoyable, though I found there is not as much matcha flavour but maybe the milk and sugar diluted it. The tapioca was great though: large and chewy, unlike a lot of other BBT places.\\n\\nIt's a nice place to sit down after a meal nearby. Well, if you can find a place to sit.\",\n",
       " \"As a lover of Matcha ...and the fact that I live just minutes away....I went back to try my beloved hot Matcha latte this time again.   This time with the $1.25 upgrade to Kyoto Uji Matcha , and with no sugar except the sweetness in the matcha red bean.....and the result was a spectacular matcha latte, the best I've tasted in the city.   No tricks, or gimmicks, just a really fresh tasting cup.  \\n\\nI was chatting with the owner and she said that earlier this year they've changed their suppliers for Matcha as well as adjusted the milk ratio, as well as changed their suppliers for almond and soy milk.    \\n\\nHaving the ability to upgrade to ceremonial grade Matcha is a game changer for me!  It also shows how Nohonhon really listens to their customers as well as works constantly to improve it's Matcha craft and ingredients.   \\n\\nThis year, Toronto's new fad seems to be Matcha cafe's ....everywhere...with a new cafe popping up every other week.    But a fad is a fad....and I must give credit where it's due to Nohonhon for being the first in Toronto....and having the experience and taking the time to tweak and make their core products right.   \\n\\nCheers to the best calm and enjoyable start to thanksgiving weekend .\",\n",
       " \"The hot taro latte are to die for! Skip the furano field though.\\n\\nTo be honest, I regretted after I got the taro latte. I regretted not getting it in large!!! It smelled heavenly! It actually tasted like those Chinese taro dessert as a drink, creamy and aromatic. The taro paste melts in your mouth and it wasn't too sweet. Having taro in a hot drink is such a great idea, it was very comforting in some way, like mana's hug lol. \\n\\nI also tried the furano field despite all the disappointed reviews, and I was not impressed. They were right, it tasted extremely watered down. I could taste a hint of the lavender, the matcha taste and milk were very faint. I assume lavender tea was added to the matcha latte which resulted the watered down drink. I understand that nohohon uses natural ingredients, but there gotta be a way to make this drink taste like lavender without watering it down, some room of improvements I guess. (If you like lavender, I highly recommend the lavender latte from Bicerin)\\n\\nWhat I loved the most besides the taro latte was service. All the staff were showing great hospitality, they were very patient on explaining the drinks to each guests since the names and descriptions were a little vague. Whenever is possible they would open the door for their guests when they were leaving, which I think was too much lol. The drinks were on the pricier side but well worth the money(don't forget about the check in offer for $1off!!)\",\n",
       " \"I've been here a couple times and although the bubble tea is pretty interesting, it's not quite memorable but does make you want to go back for more. The matcha tea I had one time tasted like fish (a sign that it has gone bad according to Google). None of the bubble teas are too sweet, they're actually quite the opposite, the sweetness is faint so you really taste the quality of the tea.\\n\\nShame they're closed right now and was replaced by yet another bubble tea place.\",\n",

We bought one drink, but got another one free, on the spot, when we took a picture of our drink and put it on Instagram with the hash tag #nohohon This was a nice touch! I love free!\\n\\nI got the large honey oolong tea with 30% sugar and less ice. They accommodate the sugar and ice despite not having it on the menu, which is pretty cool. With the drink, you get a choice of tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean included in the price. I got grass jelly. The drink came up to $5.37 (including tax). You can pay with credit card. The tea itself was pretty refreshing. Very authentic. However, the grass jelly wasnt very good. It didn't have much flavouring and was not as soft as chatimes. A possible place to improve.\\n\\nThe free drink we got was the matcha macchiato with tapioca. It was cool looking with different coloured layers, but we couldn't really taste the matcha till later because the caramel overpowered the matcha. It got better once we stirred it more, but overall, I would put more matcha than caramel. I dont like my drink too sweet. *What I do want to rave about is the tapioca. One of the best I've had. Very flavourful and soft! Melted in my mouth.  Soooo good!*\\n\\nI would definitely come back for another drink, the menu isn't extensive, which I like, and there's a whole bunch of stuff that ive never seen before like sencha mojito and yuzu lemonade. \\n\\nDefinitely worth it if you use Instagram! You buy one drink and get the next one free if you Instagram a pic of the drink you bought. You get a free drink on the same day or a coupon to redeem on another day.\",\n",

       " \"Bubble tea has already become a fairly saturated market in my area so I was intrigued when this new competitor decided to show up late to the scene. Brand-wise, they've got no leverage but location-wise, they strategically positioned themselves just far away enough from bbt giants that they might be considered a first choice for those living closer by.  \\n\\nI tried this place out last week and ordered 2 royal milk teas with tapioca, one with an oolong tea base and the other with a green tea base. To my surprise, this brand had a very distinct and unique flavour to their milk teas. Unlike any of the 15+ other brands I've tried, PannTea seems to place a heavy emphasis on a smooth, creamy and milky taste which may or may not be a good thing depending on personal taste buds. Personally, I didn't mind it but I was bummed that both of the teas weren't flavourful enough. If anything, the green tea was better than the oolong tea as it was less watered down. Another noteworthy thing is that their tapioca is inherently sweet and is likely infused with brown sugar. I ordered my drink at 30% sugar and it was still fairly sweet.\\n\\nThey also have an e-mail rewards program wherein for every $1 you spend, you get 1 point. The prices across the menu aren't cheap so you're looking at about 1 free drink every 8 paid drinks.\\n\\nPerhaps the fruit teas here are better liked but overall, I wouldn't peg this as my top milk tea brand. Maybe I'll come back another time to try the fruit teas.\",\n",
       " \"I recently went to PannTea and tried their Royal Milk tea, first thing I noticed comparing to other boba chains like Chatime and Coco is that the tea seemed more creamier which was really pleasant. As for the flavour of the milk tea, it was really nice, not overly sweetened or iced, the creaminess really elevated the drink and the tapioca was nice and chewy but not too chewy. They only have one size which is pretty much a large when comparing to Chatime's sizes and as for the prize, $6 seemed a bit overpriced at first but after tasting the drink I didn't mind it at all. Definitely recommend the place and it might be my go to boba place since it's really close to where I live. Only reason I'm not going all out and giving them 5 stars is because they only offer large size drinks.\",\n",

They also have fish balls in curry which they microwave before they serve it also comes to about $1 a piece which is overpriced. Most of all other drinks are $6. One thing I really like are the cups.

The fruit tea itself tasted good - refreshing... kinda citrusy juice. \\n\\nOrange and Grapefruit Tea with Coconut ($6.80) - This tasted quite similar to the Fruit Tea with Agars. Except it def has a more orangey taste. \\n\\nSupreme Strawberry Tea ($7.50) - Basically green tea blended with fresh strawberries... pretty good! \\n\\nSupreme Milk Pineapple Tea ($8) - They accidentally made this with mango juice instead, which they offered to re-make if I wanted but I said it was okay because you best believe I ain't complaining about mangoooo. Honestly, with the mango it tasted really good. Mango + Pineapple is always a good combo. It was supposed to be more liquidy but turned out a bit more slushy. \\n\\nUji Matcha ($6.80) - This comes with a salted cheese cap. Basically tastes like matcha with some milk. The cheese cap compliments the matcha. \\n\\nLooking forward to visit this place in the future and trying their other options - they're items are all fresh and don't taste artificial!\",\n",

I'd imagine she probably had just gotten off work, but the whole process was just weird.\\n\\nWe finally asked which drinks could be made unsweetened since the drinks we had named weren't possible to be made without sugar...because I'm sure they use some kind of powder in most of their drinks...We ended up getting just plain milk tea and jasmine milk tea.

It's not hard to missed a Boba Tea shop near Las Vegas default Filipino town, which is one reason why this place gets a decent amount of customers and not much competition in the area. The majority Filipino staff is very friendly and helpful. However, the flavor of the actual milk teas were ok plus they don't have the option to adjust sweetness level. I prefer my drinks less sweet so I'm able to taste all components of my drink. I do like the option that they have two sizes of Boba, regular and small. \\n\\nThe shop is much larger than others in town, makes it an ideal place to hangout with a group of friends or family.

I got longanisa fries and it comes with black/green tea. I upgraded to a milk tea, and she made it pretty quickly. Both milk tea and fries were good.

Lately, every time I order it tastes bitter and disgusting. It tastes like medicine. I kindly ask if they accidentally give me black tea, but they said no. It was green tea. This happened to me twice. I used to order this drink a lot so I know how it tastes. In addition to that, their customer service became weak. They don't seem to welcome you.

       " 'The gospel of small tapioca pearls, according to Chris V.\\n\\nIn the beginning, there was bubble tea. The masses tried the sweet drink and chewed thoughtfully on the tapioca pearls. And they saw that it was good.\\n\\nThe drink spread throughout Taiwan, and then across the ocean to America. So it came to pass that this beverage would build a devoted following.\\n\\nMost establishments that served this beverage utilized large tapioca pearls. Giant straws that could convey the pearls were necessary. Many would enjoy the novelty of these tools.\\n\\nBut some people would feel that these unwieldy instruments forced them to consume the drink far too quickly. They did not like this, nor did they entirely appreciate the alternative of simply not ordering the chewy boba.\\n\\nSome practitioners of the art turned to small tapioca pearls, rumored to be the original form used in the creation of bubble tea. They found a similar chewy texture that could be enjoyed through a regular, smaller straw. And with that straw, they would finally be able to sip their drink slowly.\\n\\nUnfortunately, not all vendors would embrace small tapioca. Even in such locations as San Jose and Orange County, these providers appeared to be few and far between.\\n\\nLo and behold, the small tapioca pearls have finally been brought to the great desert oasis known as Las Vegas. Whereas other businesses have ignored the allure of \"mini boba,\" one franchise of the chain called Tapioca Express (not known universally for this particular add-on) finally unveiled this option.\\n\\nOn the 11th day of the 5th month in the year of our Lord [that\\'s literally A.D.] 2015, I arrived at this first Tapioca Express of Las Vegas, and I found the small tapioca that I had only previously witnessed in the land of California.\\n\\nAlthough TapEx\\'s standard milk tea ($2.98, +$0.50 for large size) is prepared from a product that is markedly sweet, an employee did indicate that they can adjust the sugar levels of certain flavored teas. This brings significant hope for the future.\\n\\nRegardless, if the burden of an overly sweet milk tea must be weighed against the beauty of small pearls (+$0.50 per topping), I will cheerfully choose their small pearls because they are properly chewy and do not clump.\\n\\nSo come all ye boba lovers, and try the small tapioca! See what you\\'ve been missing all along.',\n",

We went in & when i went to make my order I asked the associate if they had red bean she said oh no we ran out we usually have it but we ran out today so okay then i made my order & after she said it was cash only & luckily I had cash on me & it came up to $5 when Volcano tea is way better & way cheaper but whatever. So boba is not suppose to take long considering we were the only customers there. So it was about a good 5 minutes of her standing there & the next costumers that came in was 5 minutes after my order as well & okay boba takes less than 5 minutes to make. So it was a family of 12 that came in & it took them another 10 minutes to make their order so i waited until she was done with the orders & I went up to the counter & asked for a refund because it was absurd to make me wait for almost 15 minutes for boba especially the fact that they started to make the family of 12 boba first before mine. The associate said that she was not able to give me my refund & she made an excuse that she was taking the other guest order but I explained to her that ive been waiting for a long time & it was a good 5 minutes before they came in after i made my order. I told her I just want my money back & she said well do you just want it now? because i can't give you a refund because i don't have the code... & i just asked for a manager & she said there isn't one right now & i just asked her well can you make it right now then because i seriously been waiting forever & it took less than 2 minutes to make um seriously how hard was that? this was definantly the worst customer services ive ever exsperienced & the boba wasn't even good so that was the worst $5 ive ever spent but I know for next time\",\n",

       " \"This is no longer a liquid nitrogen ice cream vendor. Instead, it's an inexpensive yet surprisingly solid dessert shop.\\n\\nBubble Mixology is in a small plaza on Spring Mountain near Jones with such notable neighbors as KJ Kitchen and TangTangTang. I'd bookmarked them a while back for liquid nitrogen ice cream, and although I was disappointed to learn that they had stopped making that product, I was more than happy to give them a try.\\n\\nI didn't get any of the drinks, although those seemed to be pretty popular. I guess that the various teas, coffees, and shakes are the inspiration behind their name, rather than the desserts which I focused on. (I might've grabbed something had I been hungrier or less fearful of caffeine at the relatively late evening hour.)\\n\\nFirst off, check out the ice cream prices. They charge $1, $1.75, or $2.50 respectively for 1, 2, or 3 scoops. The scoop size is pretty generous and the texture was smooth and free of ice crystals. I was more than happy to be able to try three flavors, with is half of their very limited and very American assortment. Lack of choices (and Asian flavors) aside, I was happy with each of my vanilla, cookies & cream, and cookie dough.\\n\\nNext, get ready to be shocked by the waffles. They're the variety which are variously known in other dessert shops as egg waffles, egglets, Hong Kong waffles, etc. The menu lists plain waffles as $2.50 and flavored waffles as $3.00, although I only paid the smaller price for some reason for my matcha waffle. It was surprisingly and pleasantly quite enjoyable. The texture stayed crispy outside and soft inside until the last bite, which took a while because I was eating the ice cream on top of the waffle. The matcha flavor was light, but that's par for the course.\\n\\nDid I mention that these prices are tax-free? Offering solid entry-level ice cream and some of the better egg waffles at these prices is mind-boggling in 2018. The lowest price I can find elsewhere in town (researching via Yelp photos) for egg waffles is $4, and I'm pretty sure ice cream isn't that cheap except at a certain popular chain with 25 more flavors than you'll find here.\\n\\nI can criticize them for a lot of things (awkward placement of water/utensil/napkin station, weird setup of menus, out-of-place metal table, relatively short hours), but service was okay considering that there were two people trying to cope with a huge family group of about 15 and cleanliness was on-point. I had a fairly comfortable visit.\\n\\nBubble Mixology isn't a true foodie spot or destination to get excited over, but it's a very affordable and competent dessert option should you find yourself in this neighborhood and not feeling as spendy as you'd need to be for trendy sweets.\",\n",

The waffle cup and milk tea options were either unavailable or not offered when I visited, but I'll be back to try them both.\\n\\nEDIT: As of April 2018, they no longer have nitrogen ice cream nor typically Asian flavors, skewing more American (vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream, etc) and serving up regular (though house-made) ice cream instead, with low prices.\",\n",
       " 'They are having free samples rn. The matcha ice cream is super tasty and it tastes exactly like what i had in japan. Luv the decoration btw!',\n",
       " \"First off, this place is open on Christmas. Which was a pleasant surprise when my family and I were looking for something fun to do, lol. \\nThis place is really hip! Everything from the minimalist decor to the nitrogen ice cream. The flavors are cool too and range from normal vanilla all the way to lavender earl gray. Which I do not recommend by the way, it was way too soapy tasting. But everything else was really delicious, especially the Nutella flavor and the bubble waffles! It's an additional $2 for a waffle and 50 cents each for toppings.\\nThe staff was very nice, and gave my cousin a waffle for free when he went to order it after already receiving his ice cream. \\nLastly, although the nitrogen ice cream is a novel concept, it really was just ice cream. Good ice cream though!\",\n",
       " 'A unique approach to ice cream and tea if you\\'re looking for something different but not too flashy. \\n\\nWhat makes Bubble Mixology unique is the fact that they offer flash-chilled nitrogen ice cream that is the smoothest, creamiest, thickest, richest, and most delicious ice cream I have ever had. \\n\\nThe ice creams are made-to-order and the cool thing is that they make it right in front of you. Since they use nitrogen, when the ice cream is being made is looks like a neat science experiment. They also brew nitrogen tea that tastes so fresh.\\n\\nI ordered their chocolate ice cream along with the Zomba Pearl white tea both were very delicious. \\n\\nThe place itself is very spacious with a variety of places to sit or stand and on the wall hangs an eye catching \"Bubble Mixology\" sign that you can\\'t help but take a photo of. At the counter were they take and make orders it looks like a sort of science lab with beakers, flasks, and test tubes, which is a fitting concept when you see the ice cream being made. \\n\\nI\\'m looking forward to my next visit because I am interested in trying their Matcha affogato. Overall I definitely would recommend this place if you\\'re looking for a different spin on ice cream and/or tea.',\n",
       " 'Try out this new spot. I love the modern contemporary design they have and the laboratory look with stainless steel appliances behind the counter. \\n\\nBubble mixology offers more than just Boba and teas. Dig into their waffle treats with the variety of ice cream and toppings. \\n\\n I ordered the Strawberry Farm (Chocolate powder, drizzle and fresh strawberries) and Sticky Cloud (housemade whipped cream, caramel drizzle and chips) both on top of a chocolate and black charcoal bubble waffle. In addition, I got a Thai tea frappe with 2 scoops of Oreo ice cream inside. I just created a perfect combo with that drink lol try it out, and share your thoughts if you like it',\n",
       " \"I heard about this place from my sister so we decided to try it out. We heard they had the ice cream with nitrogen so that's what we were looking forward to, but they told us they don't do it there anymore. What a bummer. So we decided to try the hongkong waffles with ice cream and some drinks. The one I got was the matcha and mango drink but with no boba. Then we also got the yellow tail with vanilla ice cream (which was my favorite out of the three we got), matchaholic with strawberry ice cream, and the monkey bar with vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place if I was on this side of town again.\",\n",
       " \"Recently open. The location is a bit hidden and easily over looked. It's in the same plaza with KJ Kitchen (right behind it) and Mediterranian market. Parking is easy. \\n\\nNitrogen ice cream is on the rise and this one offer different flavor. Ingredients are all natural and fresh. They use US made chocolate THCO which is based in Berkeley, CA. They also have black sesame flavor. They also have Nitrogen Teas beverages. \\n\\nWe did not try the drinks this time but we ordered the chocolate with Matcha bubble waffle. I thought the waffle taste great. The batter was not too heavy and was crispy. The chocolate ice cream was not overly sweet so you can taste the real chocolate. \\n\\nRECYCLEABLE cup to help our planet, very thoughtful! Variety of drink cups, so cute. They also have split cups if you choose two different drinks. \\n\\nThey currently have no lactose free or gluten free items on their menu. The owner mentioned they are developing new flavors and gluten/lactose free are next. I also wish they will have exciting exotic fruit taste like in CA such as Jackfruit, Durian, Lychee, etc. \\n\\nIce cream start at $5 and up. Drinks are $4.50-$8. Waffle cup is $6.50. \\n\\nWill come back and try their drinks next.\",\n",

       " \"We came here for dessert after dinner with our grown kids. They were so excited when they saw this on Yelp with a 4 star rating. It was just average. There was no wow factor at all in the presentation like the  other places we've been to. The ice creams were average. The employees were nice, the 2 girls were very friendly. 5 oz was $4.50 plus tax. 7oz was $5.50 plus tax. Slush was $4 plain, we wanted to add jelly but they were out. We will not be returning here.\",\n",
       " \"A long bus ride away if you have the patience. We had a 3 day bus pass so this worked out. The transit getting here isn't as efficient as Vancouver (yes I actually made credit to the Transit in Vancouver) but we were full from the last place. The bus we were taking was on the way to a record store so it worked out. I was really happy that this place honored holiday hours as some of the places that were on our list that were way outside the Strip  closed the week before Christmas.  There are a lot of Bubble Tea places in Richmond, BC, however, as a bubble tea person I was curious to see how a place that isn't traditionally known for the bubble tea actually does bubble tea. Firstly this place is really clean and sleek in terms of design. I had the mango orange bubble tea which tasted decent and the pearls were soft, however, not too soft. It earned a pass from me considering that I have lots of bubble tea experience. They do serve nitrogen ice cream which is a huge trend right now (or at least a trend in 2017) in Vancouver, BC. I shared a bowl with the bestie. The prices were decent even with the exchange and the customer service was friendly. I did take a few second video of the nitrogen process and posted it on my Instagram.\",\n",
       " \"The liquid nitrogen ice cream is so good and creamy. I am a matcha lover, and my favorite way to get my fix is with the matcha affogato. These guys are using high quality matcha with less sugar. We should be grateful this sweets shop is not trying to get us to eat too much uneccessary sugar. The nitro iced tea is also good, also naturally sweet. I'm loving these no-sugar needed options.\",\n",
       " \"For anyone who remembered, Dexter's Laboratory from the Cartoon Network Circa 1996-2003, will instantly have a pleasant experience, lol. Actually anyone who loves a little science activity to create a delicious ice cream will have a fun experience. Nitrogen infused have been taking the foodie scene by storm. This particular place uses nitrogen to create different flavor ice creams. I've been here a few times and always leave satisfied. I personally love the matcha flavor ice cream paired with one of their waffle puff cone with white chocolate drizzle and Cinnamon Toast Crunch toppings. However, the possibilities is endless with the different flavors and toppings available.\\n\\nThe whole process of your ice cream gives this place that ohhh and wow vibes. Definitely a must try and instagram worthy joint. The friendly staff is very helpful and patient, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Another great addition to the ever growing dessert places on Spring Mountain Rd. foodie scene.\\n\\n2017 Yelp Review #60\",\n",

       " \"WARNING: sugar overload!!!!!!\\n\\nDefinitely a great dessert place to take your family to. They have so many different options of dessert to choose from and the atmosphere is very appealing to the eye. The price isn't too bad either. I got the nitrogen ice cream with a waffle and it came with some popcorn at the bottom, drizzle and toppings. Literally so hard for one person to eat, so try sharing things. Babe got a boba tea. The price for both was worth it, especially for the sizes they came in! The employees were super helpful, friendly, and made sure we enjoyed everything before we left. We came on a windy day so I'm excited to come back when its warmer outside.\",\n",
       " \"I was sad to see when I came that there was no longer nitrogen ice cream.  It's a large space but was surprised that on a Friday evening that it was mostly empty.  I shared the s'mores and monkey bar with my family.  The waffle itself was pretty standard along with the chocolate ice cream that we ordered, very generic tasting.  The marshmallows were really tasty however.  I wanted to like this place more but it fell short of my Hong Kong style waffle expectations.\",\n",
       " \"I was following this place on social media and really looked forward to their delicious looking nitrogen ice cream and iced matcha latte!\\n\\nI can definitely say my brother and I were very pleased with our visit!\\n\\nI enjoyed a creamy sesame small cup... watched it made my hand with the nitrogren smoke blowing out of the mixing machine and everything... super cool to watch!\\n\\nAnd my iced matcha latte was very tasty. All natural ingredients... very earthy tasting. I don't like it very sweet and the way they made it was spot on.\\n\\nThe customer service was great. The lady informed us it was a soft opening and not everything was up and running yet... they were both very knowledgeable and enjoyed what they were doing.\\n\\nThe location is great; right in Chinatown... plenty of parking, easy to find, and loads of seating inside with a restroom.\\n\\nI can see this place becoming very successful!\",\n",
       " \"Ordered:\\nTaro Milk Tea with boba\\nJasmine Milk Tea with boba\\n\\nMy friend ordered the taro milk tea with boba and I ordered the jasmine milk tea. When we ordered it, they stated that they were out of boba. Understandable because it was about an hour or less until closing time. So we ordered the jelly topping (aloe jelly I think it was?!) in place of the boba. When my friend got her drink, she received thai milk tea instead. She didn't mind the mistake so she took it. When she drank it, she was not fond of the drink at all. She stated that the thai milk tea did not taste like the traditional Thai milk tea and that it was overly sweet. I then tried my drink. I did not taste the tea at all. It was pretty much super sweet milk. I unfortunately did not like it to the point that I took two sips and then tossed the rest out. Maybe it was an off day? Not too sure. Will have to go back to try the other items on the menu.\",\n",

We can have something to watch while we waiting.\\nThis place is also peace and quiet, I like to spend time here chitchat with friends.\\n\\nStaffs: The employee were friendly, they gave me suggestions for drinks and desserts, super patient.\\n\\nDessert: I ordered the bubble waffle with strawberries. I love the sweetness of the strawberries combine with the sugar powder on the waffle. Crunchy and soft taste at the same time. \\n\\nBubble tea: I ordered both Dirty Horchata and Mocha Latte.

       " 'I ordered the matcha (green tea) ice cream with the original bubble waffle very delicious! The ice cream was a little too rich and had a \"buttery\" consistency but overall very enjoyable! It is a little pricy though, I ended up paying $8 for dessert...',\n",
       " \"I came here for both their soft opening and grand opening. I personally like Sweet Spot better because they have more flavor options and topping choices. \\n\\nTexture is one of a kind. It's extremely smooth and rich. I did notice that there are some inconsistency where one of the nitro ice cream was sticky, like a caramel and stuck to my teeth. \\n\\nLike I mentioned the flavors are limited. On grand opening day however, they had new flavors which were lavender earl grey and cinnamon ginger. I heard their flavors will be rotated weekly so I may need to be on the look out for their next rotation. \\n\\nSo far I've tried most of the flavor in ice cream (chocolate, matcha, black sesame, vanilla) and matcha latte and all had bold flavors.\\n\\nI'm not sure with their price point and tiny portion, it would be worth coming here as opposed to other nitro places that offers more customizable options and toppings (and much bigger portion for the same price). Looking forward for them to step up their game.\",\n",
       " 'A great place for bubble tea lovers. Modern interior design, decent number of chairs, and TV entertainment while waiting for your drinks to be made. Lots of flavors to choose from, but my favorite so far would have to be the red bean matcha tea plus tapioca pearls (normal sugar, and less ice). \\n\\nService was ok, nothing special about it, perhaps more smile would make it better.

The tea was slightly grainy, probably due to the taro powder. Had to wait 15 mins for the drink, when there wasn't even much of a rush. \\n\\nDecent experience, I'll probably come again since it's one of the only boba places in Calgary.\",\n",
       " 'Usually very busy especially at this location. Found the charts that signalize the amount of sugar and ice you would prefer in your drink very helpful.
