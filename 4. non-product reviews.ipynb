Ok, I know we are in Vegas.  hahahaha  I also love KK donuts so after begging my friend to stop off at KK before we drive back to LA he agreed to go.  hahaha  After getting the donuts, I spotted this boba place across the street.  Well, of course, we had to go since we are right there.  hahaha\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend was super full from dinner but I had space for my boba.  I ordered the regular milk tea and it was really good.  I did forget to request less sweetness so it was rather too sweet for me but nonetheless a tasty drink.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and patient while I was deciding what to get.  Also, while we were there, we met a nice local family getting their drinks.  They raved about this place and yes, I would agree.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "I pass by here all the time and have always wondered about this place.  I decided to stop in when I was in the mood for something cold and fruity. \n",
      "\n",
      "I took at least 5 minutes to review the drink options (slushes and smoothies).  There is a list that spans one whole wall of the restaurant behind the counter and TONS of options.  Whatever your fruity craving is, I bet they have that flavor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally decided on a strawberry/pomegranate slush (I think #61 - how do they memorize all of these?  She knew which it was without looking, lol).  The employee, who was quiet but friendly, asked if I wanted to add Boba.  I'd never tried it before and it was included in the price of the drink so, why not?  \n",
      "\n",
      "FYI: the charge to pay with a card is 35 cents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My drink was ready quickly and I was pleased with the presentation.  If you've never had this experience before (and I'm pretty sure I'm the only one, but I'll describe it just in case), the cup is covered with a film that is attached to the top and you poke a large straw through it to enjoy your beverage.  The straw has to be wide to bring up those boba pearls, which you can clearly see on the bottom of your drink.  Now I don't know what these pearls are comprised of, but they are chewy and jelly-like, although they were pretty tasteless to me.  The girl who made my drink put a really good ratio of boba to slush and I was bringing them up pretty much the entire time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my dirty little secret: I don't like the boba.  I didn't enjoy the texture and it didn't have much of a taste to me so I'm going to skip it next time (I know some of you probably just gasped - \"NO BOBA?!?\" - because I've read how much you like it, lol).  I just didn't \"get it\".  But my drink itself was INCREDIBLE.  Perfect amount of sweetness and fruitiness and it seriously hit the spot.  Mine was a non-dairy slush so I'm looking forward to trying many other flavors and some of the smoothie flavors too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They serve food, which I'm curious to try, but the drinks are filling so I'm wondering when I'll get the chance to try any of it.  The decor is very simple and almost \"bare\".  The prices are really reasonable for the drinks.  I didn't pay attention to the food prices. \n",
      "\n",

She was NOT happy. LOL.\n",

      "\n",
      "Boba milk tea has been consistently good each time I visit, about once a week. I alternate between the almond, matcha, and they've even done matcha almond for me. I've had it hot, cold, iced, and smoothie form --always perfect! Love the hokkaido non dairy creamer they offer and the frequent buyer stamp card. Always nice folks behind the counter too\n",

The staff are friendly, and definitely like joke with the regulars that come in. I'm in love with their red velvet doughnuts, the only shop I've seen that carries them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is made fresh, including the iced coffees. Because of this, do be prepared to wait. It's never an issue for me, but can be a deterrent to some. They are also not packed behind the counter, I've seen maybe three people staffed at once, usually it's one or two. Again, not an issue for me, but something to keep in mind. Oh, about the powdered creamer only for the coffee? They do carry the liquid creamers, but you have to ask for it.\n",

You have the counter where you order, a small padded bench on the side and a little open space in the middle.  Very minimalist which works for this place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a good selection of drinks to choose from.  You have milk teas, macha, sencha and some fruity selections as well.  One thing to note is, unlike a lot of bubble tea places, this place uses no powder of any sort and no refined sugar as well. Also, I don;t know about all drinks, but the macha drinks we ordered were all hand made.  You can really taste the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The owner of the place is super duper nice.  She was very helpful and had a ton of knowledge behind her products.  When it comes to tea, my GF loves to ask questions and she answered them all in depth.  She always has a pleasant smile and makes you feel welcome the moment you walk in.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I can remotely gripe about is there are no seats available here.  There is a small padded bench to the side and that's it.  This place is strictly take out more or less.  Being downtown, you're usually on the go so it shouldn't bother most people at all.\n",

      "\n",
      "I went here for the first time this afternoon. I was able to have a conversation with the owner (a lovely Japanese women). She explained the concept behind her Cafe and I was nothing short of impressed! Most bubble tea stores use powders to make their drinks. The powders and not only unnatural, but laden with sugar. At Nohohon, all the ingredients are fresh! If you are lactose intolerant, they have almond milk and soy. I ordered a green tea, vanilla latte with almond milk and red bean (the red beans were in place of tapioca). It was delicious! The staff are very friendly as well, which made the experience even better. I will definitely be visiting Nohohon again! It's important to have healthier option of the foods we love and Nohohon had done that for Toronto with bubble tea.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Didn't really sought out for this place, was just in the area and when I looked it up on yelp how lucky was I that it had an overall 4 star review. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was the only customer in the store and it was around 6pm, July 4th. I looked at the menu to figure out what I wanted, but I felt so awkward because the girls behind the counter were just waiting for me to order, so I just told them it's my first time and what they recommended. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conveniently, they had a most popular list of drinks that people order, and I opted for the top fruit tea with grass jelly. I kept the sweetness and ice level at normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a buy 2 get one free deal going on until July 7th but since it was just me I only got one drink. Overall, the drink had a fruity, bitterness to it which paired well with the grass jelly. Definitely need to try out their other drinks.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptional service right when I walked into the store and left! I thought the lady behind the counter was the owner but she said how she was in NY opening the second Nohohon store there. She was very bubbly, I loved her personality. I will for sure be coming back here to try their other drinks!\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Tokyo fog with tapioca and I was surprised. I expected it to be sweet but it was not too sweet which made the matcha flavor stronger. There was also hints of vanilla which I loved!! I see myself buying this again someday\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Nohohon is a cute, tiny tea store that specializes in matcha drinks. The menu is rather small, but they do offer lactose-free and sugar-free substitutes. It's not Taiwanese style- it's definitely Japanese, as you can probably tell from the matcha whisks, tatami seats and the small size of the tea room. (Seriously- a lot of Japanese cafés are the size of a cupboard.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There's only one barista behind the counter, and if there happens to be one or two more people in front of you, you'll end up waiting for ages for your drink. Exercise patience while chilling in Nohohon! They accept vicinity, ritual, and they often have good deals on Instagram. As well, it's heated up soooo nicely during the winter- you'll feel snug and warm indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hot drinks taste so good on a cold winter day! However I did not like Furano Field, which was supposed to have lavender in it. They have other lavender drinks as well but I don't recommend them. I did enjoy the Tokyo Fog very much! It's supposed to have vanilla in it, and it's sweet but not overwhelming. I find the prices to be pretty normal for bubble tea joints- usually $5-$6 depending on what toppings you want to get.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely come back to try out their other drinks! And, maybe to try their onigiri? When I was here there was only 1 sad onigiri on the counter.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Where do I start. This is definitely not your generic Chai Time or TeaShop168. I got the Matcha Latte with grass jelly and it excited me to see a lady behind the counter actually whisking my matcha before completing my drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "-Good balance of matcha, milk and sweetness.\n",
      "-The grass jelly is not super soft (I like it a little more firm) \n",
      "-The taste of matcha is so distinct and not too bitter and is elevated by a hint of sweetness. \n",
      "-The milk ties it all together to give it a creamy feel. \n",
      "-Nothing takes away from one another.\n",
      "-Staff is super nice \n",
      "-Decor is so pretty and well put\n",
      "-There is variety but not its not overwhelming (like some tea shops that have rows and rows of drinks) \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-cannot accommodate a big sit-down group\n",
      "-there is only one in Toronto\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Nohohon is definitely under-rated! I would say that Nohohon is better than many of the other bubbletea and drink places in the downtown area. The matcha drinks are very good and going into this restaurant reminds me of going into a restaurant in Japan (in other words, it is very small but clean and cozy). I also found that the customer service was very good. Drinks were never just passed or left on the counter. The server would actually walk out from behind the bar and hand you the drink with both hands. My favourite drink so far is the Lavender Matcha which was a very frothy matcha-lavender drink.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",

      "\n",
      "I love this place. The lady is so sweet that is always behind the counter. She helps me choose my tea or smoothie when I can't make up my mind. Always smiling - just lovely. Last time I got the almond smoothie with boba and it was amazing. I wish I had one right now!  Stop by if you are in the area and support this cute shop!!\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Their official name is Nohohon Tea Room and...it's literally the size of a room.\n",
      "The interior is nicely decorated and gives you the whole japanese tea house feel. They also share a washroom with the ajisai AYCE next door, so you're getting the luxury service there. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's a tatami mat up front where you can sit if that is your preference. Otherwise, there are wooden chairs available if you would rather not feel like an emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a japanese themed tea house so you have options like matcha milk tea, houjicha milk tea, yuzu lemonade, taro smoothies, or momo oolong. They also provide hot pots of teas if you're feeling less sugary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bubble Teas come in small, medium, or large cups, with soy or almond milk, as well as one free topping (tapioca, lychee jelly, grass jelly, or red bean). You can also customize the sugar or ice levels, but you'll have to take some initiative there. I didn't think about it and ended up with ice in my drink. The price is about the same as other tea places, if you include that one free topping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vicinity is accepted if you use that rewards program (you might as well, since most tea places offer it).\n",

      "\n",
      "I ordered the green haze with almond milk and tapioca, which is a matcha latte with hints of hazelnut flavour. The drink was enjoyable, though I found there is not as much matcha flavour but maybe the milk and sugar diluted it. The tapioca was great though: large and chewy, unlike a lot of other BBT places.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bubble Mixology is in a small plaza on Spring Mountain near Jones with such notable neighbors as KJ Kitchen and TangTangTang. I'd bookmarked them a while back for liquid nitrogen ice cream, and although I was disappointed to learn that they had stopped making that product, I was more than happy to give them a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't get any of the drinks, although those seemed to be pretty popular. I guess that the various teas, coffees, and shakes are the inspiration behind their name, rather than the desserts which I focused on. (I might've grabbed something had I been hungrier or less fearful of caffeine at the relatively late evening hour.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, check out the ice cream prices. They charge $1, $1.75, or $2.50 respectively for 1, 2, or 3 scoops. The scoop size is pretty generous and the texture was smooth and free of ice crystals. I was more than happy to be able to try three flavors, with is half of their very limited and very American assortment. Lack of choices (and Asian flavors) aside, I was happy with each of my vanilla, cookies & cream, and cookie dough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, get ready to be shocked by the waffles. They're the variety which are variously known in other dessert shops as egg waffles, egglets, Hong Kong waffles, etc. The menu lists plain waffles as $2.50 and flavored waffles as $3.00, although I only paid the smaller price for some reason for my matcha waffle. It was surprisingly and pleasantly quite enjoyable. The texture stayed crispy outside and soft inside until the last bite, which took a while because I was eating the ice cream on top of the waffle. The matcha flavor was light, but that's par for the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I mention that these prices are tax-free? Offering solid entry-level ice cream and some of the better egg waffles at these prices is mind-boggling in 2018. The lowest price I can find elsewhere in town (researching via Yelp photos) for egg waffles is $4, and I'm pretty sure ice cream isn't that cheap except at a certain popular chain with 25 more flavors than you'll find here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can criticize them for a lot of things (awkward placement of water/utensil/napkin station, weird setup of menus, out-of-place metal table, relatively short hours), but service was okay considering that there were two people trying to cope with a huge family group of about 15 and cleanliness was on-point. I had a fairly comfortable visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bubble Mixology isn't a true foodie spot or destination to get excited over, but it's a very affordable and competent dessert option should you find yourself in this neighborhood and not feeling as spendy as you'd need to be for trendy sweets.\n",

      "Came here on a Sunday night and to my surprise, it was empty. This location is a bit tucked away in the corner of the market square it's in, definitely not very visible from the street. The place is very spacious and has an expansive food prep area. There were 2 ladies working at the time and they greeted us kindly as we arrived. I ordered a matcha double scoop with Chocolate bubble waffle and white mochi. It took some time for them to whip it up but it was well worth the wait! The ice cream was not too overpowering with the matcha flavor, the bubble waffle was warm and inviting, and the mochi was the perfect texture and fresh. It all come together deliciously and I was extremely satisfied! It is a little bit pricey but I think it is worth it. I would definitely recommend visiting Bubble Mixology to satisfy after-dinner-sweet-cravings! The Bubble Waffles are freshly made to order and so is the ice cream! I also saw that they have a large selection of drinks/teas. Lots of flavor syrup bottles line the wall behind cash register. I plan to come back when I am in Las Vegas again! :)\n",

She made normal fries instead of sweet potato ones and when I pointed it out, she was so nice and accommodated me and my friends really well. She even gave me a card for a free drink for the trouble despite the fact that I really didn't mind the mix-up. Thanks Latea!

      "\n",
      "There's a flavors chart on the wall behind the cashier. My favorites are the house milk tea and the oolong milk tea. But they also have some cool floral flavors like Rose or Bouquet Milk Tea and Salted Caramel Milk Tea!  You can also customize how much ice you want as well as how sweet you want the drink (regular, less sweet, half sweet, none, etc.), which is pretty cool. Their sizes, especially the small and medium, are pretty standard. But their large size is huge! When I order a small oolong milk tea with no add-ons, it comes to about $4.40 something, which I think is acceptable, but a little pricier than I'd prefer.\n",

The man behind the counter was unbelievably helpful, providing us with samples before we actually settled on our flavor. They allow you to add boba to anything - which is fantastic. The boba was fresh and flavorful. The tazo is to die for, I also highly recommend the green tea and peanut butter oreo!\n",

The interior is sparse and rather cold, actually, but before I could be put off by this the owner behind the counter greeted me and correctly assumed I was on the hunt for boba. He handed me a sample of the mango smoothie they serve - delicious! Tastes like it actually comes from mangoes.\n",

      "I ordered a milk tea though, and while waiting for my drink, the owner handed me a coupon and one of those stamp cards, and went on to explain the ice cream they serve is handmade. Again, he gave me a sample of banana split and tiramisu flavors. The banana split was divine, and I normally dislike banana flavors alone. \n",

      "I remember eons ago when bubble tea was a powdery mix of sugar, food colouring, some tea perhaps, and more sugar.  Did I say sugar?  The past few years, we've had a huge influx of Taiwanese, Chinese, and other super popular Bubble Tea Brands from Asia and I'm glad for it!  You're able to customize the level of sugar and ice with far more inventive add ins .. best of all, it actually taste like real brewed tea.\n",

      "We came late one Saturday thinking it wouldnt be so bad ... daaaaaang.  So this is where all the Asian high school seniors hang out.  Ok, I'm already sensing the Mean Girl vibe ... I guess I'm wearing the wrong pink.  All the tables were taken (and there's not too many to start) and the line is about 3/4 the length of the store.  It .. is... popular. \n",
      "\n",
      "The great thing is the service is on point and moves the line quickly.  Even though we saw the big line, the ordering here is very efficient with a dedicated staff getting the order and 3 people behind the counter are constantly making the drinks.  I would say it only took us a little over 7 minutes to get to the front.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I mentioned, ordering here is easy... it helps to know what you like ahead of time and the big monitors above the ordering station help show you the most popular ones in addition to the other drinks.  I would say that this isnt your typical \"blueberry milk boba tea\" but more closer to the authentic boba tea in Asia.  Richer in tea flavour and creamier in texture ... these are far more enjoyable. Best part was that I dialed down the sugar content so i could blink later on and not crash heavily from the sugar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2 Ladies (aka. Coco black tea with pudding and pearl) - With 50% sugar and no ice, I found this hitting the spot on a warm evening.  Its quite good in flavour as the 50% sugar let more of the tea flavour come out.  The pudding and pearl gives it a bit more sugar so having it lower wasn't an issue.  The pearls were perfect... chewy but not needing to invest in another set of molars.  As someone mentioned, perfect for the inner child to use them blow dart style.  4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "Coconut Coco black tea with pearls - Using the same milk tea as the 2 ladies, I liked this one too... even though the sugar was dialed down to 30%, I found it to be a bit sweeter than mine because the coconut jelly is quite already sweet. I did like how it added a nice coconut flavour. 4/5\n",

There were a few tables that emptied, so I was able to grab a table for my friend and I. While waiting, I looked to their board menu behind the counter for what I wanted to try and to listen to what some of the customers were ordering.  Immediately, I was excited because they carried Assam black tea, so of course that will be my first order and my friend decided on Deerioca soy milk for hers.\n",

      "As we waited for our orders, I decided to peruse through their website and found that they made their own tapioca and used sugar cane to sweetened their drinks. Our drinks came and upon a simple instructions on how to shake our drinks for optimum taste, I took a sip and and was not disappointed. I got a 30% sugar on mine and it was just the right sweetness, sugar cane gives it a much rounder taste, the tapioca were chewy. I will definitely have to go back and try more flavours. \n",

      "\n",
      "Right when you walk in, the store is well decorated with purple walls and a big community table in the middle. The ordering counter is to the right and the menu board is behind the counter. There are board games you can play with your friends too. There are menus at the front counter too and it has pictures of the desserts. They have rolled ice cream, sno fluff, boba drinks, the puffy egg waffle things, and teas. I really wanted to try the sno fluff to see what that was about and it was so good. I had it for dine in and not to-go, but you have options. I tried the guava flavor for a dollar more at it is worth it. The sno-fluff price runs about $5, so the guava at the time was $6. What comes out is this really cool layered kind of shaved ice dessert treat. The layers make it super airy and the guava flavor was bright, floral, and tropical. It's not like a snow cone at all. Just smooth and delicate. Great option on a hot day when you don't want something too heavy or full of cream. The lady (owner?) came out to check on me to see how I was doing (so sweet) and if I was enjoying my dessert. I told her it was great and that I will be back. She informed me she uses fresh fruit so that the products tastes better and I agree you can taste it.\n",

Although they're longer partnered with Ono Sweetz 702 (which was responsible for most of my rave review last time around), Hi-Coffee still offers quite a few pastries, and I eagerly dove in to sample several.\n",

      "Bacon, Egg, Cheddar Croissant Sandwich ($5.50): a very simple take on this breakfast classic. My friend tried a bit of this and equated it to a fast food breakfast sandwich. I couldn't really argue, given the modest amounts of every filling and the lackluster croissant. And flavor-wise, it just wasn't anything special.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blueberry Scone ($2.75): not as rich in flavor as my favorite scones, but copious amounts of blueberries. More importantly, good texture, especially the crunch on the outside. Most importantly, it's surprisingly affordable compared to other offerings here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guava Haupia Dessert Bar ($3.50): can't-miss desserts are not something that I've typically associated with Henderson, but this fits the bill. It's like a light, airy, coconut-y cheesecake, especially considering the base crust of this. The guava icing wasn't that important here, and I'd probably have enjoyed the non-guava version to an equal extent. Definitely gonna come back for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chocolate Coconut Muffin ($2.75): the employee recommended this when I asked, and she was so on point.

It's not always available, so get it when you see it!\n",

      "Almond Croissant ($4.50): I'll give them a pass on the texture because I waited a day to try it, but there is a baffling lack of almond flavor and toppings aside from some burnt almonds on the top of the croissant. This is a mediocre product at best and probably should be removed from the offerings posthaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pikake Green Milk Tea ($4.50, discounted to $3.60 Mon-Fri 3-6pm): went back during their kinda-sorta-happy-hour to try this drink, but it still wasn't worth the price with the massive ice bomb that took up somewhere from one-third to one-half of the cup. The boba wasn't spot-on either, with most of the spheres falling apart too easily. It's too easy to find perfectly al dente pearls these days, even in Las Vegas, but apparently Henderson is still lagging behind. The tea was pretty nice at least, with a jasmine-esque flavor that I probably would've enjoyed if it hadn't run out during the drive home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacon Cheddar Scone ($2.75): now this one hit the spot. I picked this up along with the milk tea, and it had the enjoyable texture of the sweet scones with the richness of bacon and cheddar. Another big winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Butter Mochi ($2.50): a rectangular cut of a ubiquitous pastry. It's chewy but not overly so, but the butter and coconut flavor wasn't impressive. Best enjoyed for the texture rather than the flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi-Coffee isn't the best cafe around by any means; its pastries are hit or miss (definitely not a good croissant bakery) but the hits are home runs or at least triples. I'll probably be back on occasion. I'll also have to try the fresh fruit smoothies, especially if I skip the boba.\n",

I think they misread or thought it was 50% MORE sugar instead of LESS... (I have uploaded a picture that the label says Half sugar) I hope they pay more attention next time. I understand that business can get overwhelming; however, this shouldn't be an excuse since there was only 2 orders before mine and there wasn't a line behind me.

Both are really good and I am going to have to try the cap with something else just to know whether I like it or not.  Nothing on them again but personally I am not a fan of the whole sea salt/salted caramel craze but willing to try again.  Our server was good at explaining other menu items and we will be back.  Only really bad thing is no small spoons to sample different flavors.  Oh and they also now have free Wi-Fi inside.  Guess they do read other reviews.\n",

I usually order a mango green tea or a mango smoothie since mango is my favorite fruit. Also the place isn't too crowded like other boba places, so we get quick service, but still high quality. They will happily redo drinks if you don't like the way yours came out. Lastly, they have free WiFi and it's really close to my school, so I can literally walk there after school and hangout with my friends.\n",

I got the pistachio almond milk tea, and it was perfect! Unfortunately my friend's Nagasaki was a bit too sweet. You can pick sweetness level when you order, so maybe we will get it one level lower next time.\n",
      "There were plenty of tables and chairs, and they even had some board games.\n",
      "The only thing about this place was that their music were way too quiet, which made the entire place too quiet. Maybe because we were the only customers there at the time, but we honestly felt like we had to whisper to each other when we were talking. I guess it's better than them blasting out their music, but it still felt pretty awkward lol maybe raise the volume just a bit?\n",

The third time I went here I had my friend check the place out with me. I was able to hear everything she said because the music is not loud at all and trust me that's a huge thing. I've been to so many boba places and it's rare to find a place that has such soothing music. \n",
      "\n",
      "Customer service: It was honestly one of the best I've ever experienced. I've been here three times already and I always feel so welcomed. They're always so nice and patient. For my office, it was my time to get us boba so I called to order and I will tell you,  some of my friends are picky... When I ordered for about 8 people the person on the phone took the time to really understand what I said and got all of them correctly. I told him that I would be there in 10 minutes but I got there earlier yet as soon as I got there everything was done, prepared with labels and already .  Seriously, three times I've been here and three times they got my orders perfectly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The boba drink itself: I've gotten two kinds of drinks for myself. One , a jasmine milk tea with the cap and boba and the other, mango smoothie with boba. Both with almond milk instead of regular milk. Boba quality is chewy and sweet so you can tell that they actually took the time to make it. It's not how some boba places have their boba a little on the harder side so it takes a while longer to chew. Also, the taste was very fresh for both drinks. Although, this may be more subjective. If you like your boba softer all around and actually taste the sweetness then this place is great for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other: They have a blackboard in front where you order and it says that they will remake it. They also have another black board placed on the right showing that they will adjust sugar level and milk teas to creamy or less creamy. On the blackboard behind them is their menu and you can choose what kind of milk you want. If you're lactose intolerant like me then there's the almond milk option which I always ask for. Of course this will cost extra. Their sign is hard to find because it's not on the roof but under the shade but it's close to McDonald's and you'll see that their name is on a banner. They have wifi and the password is on anither board.\n",

The milk added made it creamy and not watered down at all. The boba in my drink was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, my friend's drink had a good amount of hard crunchy boba balls in theirs. I also bought some macarons. I was pretty excited because they were so dang cheap. $1.50 each. I told myself if they were good I was going to buy the entire case. The sesame one was hard. No cracking of the shell to a googy center. The flavor wasn't bad though. It wasn't great though either. I used that as my scale for the rest of them so I determined I would never buy them again. I ended up eating my Oreo and pistachio ones later the next morning and they were significantly better in flavor and texture. I will buy these again.

However, it's actually best accessed through the parking lot that's a bit uphill past the plaza. I only found it after scouring the rest of the complex and realizing that there was a business behind Hue Thai, one that has windows which are (for good reason) painted opaque.\n",

You know, the one that really ramps up what restaurants such as Hooters and Twin Peaks are trying to do. Let's just say that the employees here wear little more than a smile and a very friendly demeanor (although the owner seems to be fine in a hoodie and pants - good for him and very good for us).\n",

      "I had a large milk tea ($4.95) with the ubiquitous tapioca pearls ($0.60). It's the basic drink to try anywhere, and it came out bubbly as expected in a good milk tea. Flavorwise, the milk tea was strong without being sickeningly sweet at 100%. I tasted a lot of honey, which I later found out wasn't from the sweetening agent, just the boba. The green honey boba that is. Green enough to surprise me when I finally looked at those little balls closely enough to see the color. But apparently that's how they come naturally, and the most important thing is that they had exactly the right chewy texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Yelp buddies are right about Milk Teaze: great drinks, great service. Best milk tea on Spring Mountain so far, which means that I'll be back after future non-AYCE dinners in the area to try more of the drinks and maybe even a savory snack as long as it's nighttime (bah humbug to the business hours) and I don't have parents in tow. Or maybe I'll bring them along anyway and see what happens.\n",

If not, trust me, I won't hesitate to give anyone a headbutt or an uppercut. The Boba Babes are friendly and easy to talk to. They're like little sisters I like to hang out with and not some cheapo's. They taught me how to play Flappy Bird - I did terrible.\n",

      "I absolutely dislike anything rose flavored. Rose flavored anything tastes like soap to me. One of the Boba Babes was like, \"why did you order it?\" In hopes that I would maybe one day like it - that day is now. It has fruity and floral notes. 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is clean and I love how they have electrical outlets and USB ports on almost every part of the shop so I can charge my phone. Clear acrylic chairs, board games, cards, heart-shaped bendy straws, red and brown walls. They're planning on having karaoke night or some form of entertainment in the future. It's a nice spot to chill and hangout. Now, if you're a sleazebag with a FUPA fetish that likes to wave your small gun around, this is not the place for you.\n",

They were super nice and explained all the different kinds of matcha tea, the customization of the level of sweetness you want in your drinks, and he even let us sample a few of the mousses. We tried their signature cheese mousse and the tiramisu. Personally, the thought of cheese mousse in my matcha drink just doesn't sound right to me. I'm sure it taste bomb af but we opted for the tiramisu. (I might be brave enough next time and choose the cheese mousse option.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So we ordered the Uji Imperial Matcha with tiramisu mousse and the Peach Matcha. We really enjoyed both drinks. I'm sure it's obvious but adding the mousse option makes the drink so smooth and creamy while the iced peach matcha was very refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day. So different drinks for different moods.\n",

      "I'm not a huge fan of waffles so I was skeptical when boy brought it home for breakfast.  The waffle was very light and airy.  I had the original batter.  According to the menu he brought home they have all kinds of flavor a of dough you can choose from including red velvet.  My waffle was covered in strawberry slices and whip cream.  It came with a side of eggs and bacon.  I won't lie, I was impressed with how much I enjoyed the waffle.  I have no idea if it's a good deal or not since I wasn't there when the purchase was made.  I'd like to eat there again and actually eat in the restaurant.  I saw they had a waffle with Nutella.  Add some strawberries to that and I'm in heaven.  They also have waffle sandwiches and pizzas made out of waffles.  Personally I think a sandwich made out of waffles is too many carbs and too much bread but hey, don't knock it until you try it.  They have a decent selection if Boba tea which I plan to try sometime soon.  I have nothing to compare it to because I've never had boba tea before but a lot of the reviews brag about how good it is.  It's located in the smiths shopping center behind PTs and near subway.  I'm giving it four stars just on the food.  I can't assess the service or cleanliness of the restaurant. Big you're in the Aliante area I would give it a whirl.\n",

This place is consistently amazing. Every drink, every banh mi, every choice is delicious. The sandwiches are filled with meat and topped with the most scrumptious and tangy pickled carrots.

I like that they have different flavored loaf breads, like taro or green onion. They also serve rice bowls and simple noodles.

Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped, but I won't hold that against them. The lady behind the counter simply put strawberry flavoring powder on black milk tea and blended it. I'm not a fan of powders and syrups because they make a drink taste overly sweet and synthetic. To sum it up, I recommend their black milk tea but not their strawberry milk tea.

      "I'm literally sitting inside Kung Fu Tea right now taking a break from my work to write this review. It's my first time at here and I'm very impressed! I've heard lots of great things about this place, so I had to come check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere: From what I can tell so far, it's really chill. The seats are comfortable, there are a handful of tables, and it's quiet/relaxing. It's definitely not as crowded as places like Chatime, but tastes just as great! They play soft Asian music in the background which I'm not the biggest fan of... but this is Chinatown we're talking about so I wouldn't expect anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service: The baristas behind the counter seem nice and friendly. They're also patient because I pretty much stood by the cashier for a good 10 minutes staring at the menu while they waited for me to order and gave me a run down of what the popular drinks are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks: There are a wide variety of drinks here, but I decided to be super basic and get a regular Pearl Milk Tea under the King Fu part of the menu. Oddly enough, the simplest drink here still tastes different and unique. I love the flavour - it's creamy, not too sweet, and has a delicious milky taste! They use honey in your drinks as well so maybe that has something to do with it. I got a regular amount of honey and it still tasted good to me; wasn't too sweet or overpowering at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great bubble tea place in Toronto/Chinatown. Also makes for a good study or remote work spot. I would definitely return to try more of the drinks on the menu!\n",

      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "This place has pretty good bubble tea and is good for groups. I defiantly recommend the pearl milk tea with taro. At first I found it grainy because it didn't stir it properly but once I did it was really good. The overall atmosphere is nice and simple. The woman behind the desk was very kind. It's in a great location, in the heart of Chinatown.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ambiance: \n",
      "A faux greenery back wall flashes bright LED lettering \"Dripp it like it's hot.\" Absolutely Instagram-worthy surely attracting millennials including myself. Customers stayed behind waiting to lick their ice cream cones so they can take the perfect picture with the cute backdrop. Within hours of opening, many, many people have already posted pictures on social media. I think they did a good job of promoting the new place so many people who are active on social media were aware of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grand Opening: \n",
      "The grand opening of Dripps was this past Saturday, September 29th. The place was open from 4 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. My friend and I didn't want to wait so long in line, so we came after dinner around 8:30. The line was still super long! So congrats, Dripps Co., on the successful new venture. Your soft serves and colorful teas are a hit! All items were BOGO and will be BOGO for the first week since opening.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Cup or Cone (one size only)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Mix-In: All soft serves are vanilla only and you can choose your favorite childhood cereal including Lucky Charms, Cap'n Crunch, Frosted Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Froot Loops, and many more, that they will blend in with the vanilla soft serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Toppings: You can choose from a list of toppings they have. Most of them are more dry cereal but a few toppings I spotted are the usual froyo toppings like cookie dough and crushed oreos. You can pay 50 cents extra for other toppings from a list that includes fruit and other yummies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cup of Soft Serve w/ One Topping: I ordered the soft serve in a cup mixed with one of my favorite super sugary childhood cereals, Cap'N Crunch. I topped it with cheesecake bites, my go-to topping at froyo places. The combination was amazing. The ice cream is so rich and creamy, the amount that they serve is just enough. The cereal mixed in was a little crunchy and grainy, but still so delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend the soft serves. I think even just the plain soft serve would have been tasty!\n",

      "They also serve matcha teas, rose milk teas, matcha coffees, and thai tea. You can add boba to it if you like. I still need to try these, but I have heard from the other customers, that they do not disappoint. My next visit, I would love to try either the rose milk or matcha coffee. Everything is aesthetically pleasing, I'm sure the taste matches the beauty of these drinks as well!\n",

      "This place was not in the least bit like what I thought it would be from tons of friends descriptions. I was imagining a quaint Victorian Tea shop instead of a warehousey looking, small, very bare coffee shop with a small display case of donuts. With that said the ladies behind the counter were top notch thus the four stars. I was on the fence to rate it three or four. Four for local and great service. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and a cinnamon crunch doughnut hole. The pastry was very tasty but not the best in town and for some reason I disliked the sandwich. I do not know why this is so it might have just been me. I do not hold it against them. I am very picky about my chicken salad and for some reason I did not like the way it tasted. It seemed to have a bad after taste that stayed with me and tasted more like tuna, which I do not like. Like I said I do not hold it against the place. I have preconceived notions and am spoiled on excellent Chicken Salad and it ruins it for other places. I always search but never find an equivalent. Ha! Also, I did not see any other goodies besides doughnuts. I would have liked to buy some cookies or scones to take to my Bunco party. Maybe they were sold out or Sundays are limited? \n",
      "\n",
      "Since I do not live in the neighborhood it would not be worth it for me to go back when I live closer to the Glendale tea shops. However,  I would definitely go back if I was in the area to try other pastry and to support local business. The ladies were so funny and kind that I most certainly would go again just to visit them. If you live near by I would say check it out. I have friends in the neighborhood who swear by their pastries and just plain regular coffee.\n",

      "Brand new Vietnamese restaurant in Gastonia. Located in the old Quiznos space behind Walgreens. Nothing fancy as far as decor. The people that run the place are very friendly and helpful. The menu focuses on three main dishes- Bahn Mi, Pho and Bun. The prices are reasonable but reminiscent of Charlotte prices (and may be a turn off to some, especially in the Gastonia market). The lemongrass grilled pork Bahn mi, at $7, was awesome - great smoky flavor to the pork. The Pho came in second. I had mine with thin sliced sirloin. It's served with the usual goodies (sprouts and basil) to mix in. The chili sauce here is great and goes well on the sandwich or stirred into the soup.\n",

      "What an amazing addition to Gastonia. I've had better, but the food is very good here and so close to our house. It's nice to have to not drive all the way into Charlotte. The fresh spring rolls are nummy, they have really good pho, and also the chicken bahn mi is delightful. They seem to keep busy, but not behind. This is a good sign that they may be here to stay! They also have Vietnamese iced coffee. Yum. It's a very casual atmosphere and nice for lunch or dinner. Very sweet staff. I hope you will consider giving them a try so that we can keep some more choices other than nasty big box Sysco food in our area.\n",

      "Nice little spot. There aren't many options for healthy eating in Gastonia other than Panera bread. And I get tired of eating at Panera bread all the time. I guess the better option would be for me to pack my own lunch has time for that? Plus, I like to find new and interesting spots to try different types of cuisine. Upon first glance this place may not seem like anything special. It's tucked behind Walgreens in a little strip mall type of area. I was greeted by a friendly cashier. It's a small place but the windows are bright and sunny. They also play R&B music which I'm a fan of. I ordered the #10 which is a combo plate (see menu for description). They give you a lot of food for the money. This combo was delicious. Skewered shrimp, tender pork over noodles with cucumbers, carrots and some tasty sauce. Yum YUM!! I'll be returning!\n",

The girl behind the counter is incredibly sweet, the warm milk tea is amazing, and the froyo is great. Haven't seen too many places with taro flavored AND green tea flavored froyo in the same place and those are my two favorite flavors! I've been here 5 times now, and this is the first time I've remembered to check in because I wasn't distracted by my food :P\n",

Needless to say, the noise level was not ideal. \n",

I called the server over and asked if he could do anything about the noise, and he politely asked the group to keep it down. A few minutes later, he came to our table and offered us a free hot chocolate and apologized. I thought it was a lovely gesture.\n",

There is one large communal table (with hanging outlets!) and lots of 2 seater tables (with outlets!) The chairs are outdoor chairs and are surprisingly comfy for those long, long hours. \n",

      "Since this was the main reason we came to Loftti, it was already a given that we were going to order that. However, with much help from the 2 nice girls behind the counter, we were able to choose our two boba drinks: Royal Thai milk tea and a Jasmine Green latti with boba. After ordering, we went to sit in the comfortable sofas to wait for our food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks were brought out first. A latti just seemed like a regular boba drink, but we were pleased with the quality. However, someone in the group pointed out the tapioca balls were a bit chewer than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the spotlight desert! For all who don't know what raindrop desert ($3.50) is, it's a jiggly blob made out of mineral water and agar (the thing that gives it a Jell-O-like consistency). Since the cake itself has almost no taste, it's served alongside roasted soybean flour (kinako) and a sugary syrup called kuromitsu. When it was brought out to us, the girls instructed us to mix the flour and syrup together before eating. Thankfully they told us, because separately they were disgusting. After mixing the two to create a paste with the wooden spoons accompanying the desert, we dug in!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't expect any flavor from the cake itself. All the nutty, sweet flavor you will get is from the paste you create. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised! The flavor wasn't too overpowering. Since it was about the size of the palm of my hand, you really pay for the amount you get.\n",

      "Cute little boba shop in Spring Valley with hipster interior decor from succulents to wood themed tables. The honey milk black tea was excellent. The boba balls were much firmer than I was used to. I didn't get to try their main attraction, the raindrop cake, but maybe I'll come back for it another day. It is quite dark inside because Loftti is hidden behind the plaza away from the sunlight, so I wouldn't recommend it for studying. It is a great spot to chill and hang out with friends over boba. If you stay for some time, fart- like smells will pop in and out to say hello. I'm not sure if it was something that they were cooking in the back or gases that were released from the people around me, but it wasn't a pleasant smell. I stayed for about two hours until I couldn't stand it anymore and left.\n",

      "I was going to wait until my next visit to review when I try the raindrop dessert, but the Salted Caramel Frozen Latti was too good so I just had to write my review while I still have the taste of heaven in my mouth! As soon as I stepped inside the establishment, I could tell I was in for a treat. It was later at night and there was a family seated near the entrance, but the overall mood of the place was calm and relaxing. The menu is on the wall behind the counter and is basically broken into: hot tea, iced tea, frozen tea, fruit smoothies, shaved ice, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Salted Caramel frozen latti and Taro frozen latti. It took just a bit longer than anticipated for my drinks to be ready, but it seemed like only two women were working at the time, and the family before me were only starting to get their order. The women were very polite, as someone else on here mentioned. I asked if they make the raindrop dessert to-go, but sadly they don't; I couldn't try it on this visit due to time constraints. That's another reason for me to come back!\n",
      "\n",
      "The salted caramel was pure heaven! I could taste notes of sweet caramel and, at other times, the saltiness. It was surprisingly not super sweet at all. I tasted the taro and it was just as yummy. I could taste the distinct flavor of taro which was not masked by an excess of sweetness. It also did not have that graininess you sometimes taste from the powdered mix. The 24oz is perfect for one person and you will most likely not want to share!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this will be my new boba spot from now on! I know another boba spot opened down the road from here, but I'll probably be coming to LOFTTI instead!\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: The raindrop dessert was fantastic. They explained that you should swirl the powder and sauce in a circle around the raindrop and then eat it. All of the flavor comes from the sauce. During this visit I also got the honeydew frozen latti and the matcha frozen cotton candy. The honeydew was perfect. It had the perfect amount of sweetness which complemented the honeydew flavor so well. The frozen cotton candy is reminiscent of snow ice, but not nearly as thick and is very light in flavor. Everything is so yummy!\n",

Generic I know... but they all of their drinks well. Sometimes a place might make their drinks too fast and the drink will be powdery or watery but Loffti Latti's are always perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why: The service we receive at Loffti is exceptional. The staff is so friendly. The fact that it's one of the closest \"boba\" cafe's to us is a big deal. We can pick up a drink on the way out before starting out errands or pick one up on the way home after a long day. The decor at Loffti is modern and inviting. The place is always spotless. I like the big huge table right in the front that invites people to sit together.\n",

The location in Irvine is always packed so I was excited when they opened up in Vegas. Came here on a 84 degree sunny Sunday and boy did it hit the spot. Parking is small in front but there is additional parking behind the dessert spot. The menu has pictures if you do not know what to order. I wanted to try the herbal jellys but got the mocha shaved ice because I was with a large party and wanted something we could all share. The mocha shaved ice was very good. Their condense milk wasn't overpowering sweet and the ice cream on top was refreshing. The mocha was chewy and soft. This dish was large enough for a party of 4. I also got a mochi pudding and melon drink. Everything I ordered was great for a hot day and I'm definitely will come by to try different things on the menu.\n",

I loved his recommendations and we njoyed our drinks.  The owners happen to come by while we were there.  They made us feel like regulars.  I recommend trying Tea Drops.

I appreciated the Sriracha and Hoisin sauce on the table because I always like to add spice to my pho.  I definitely recommend trying this place out.  My only complaint was the guy sitting behind me slurping the heck out of his pho but I suppose that just means it's delicious.\n",

I love milk tea but some places are just too sweet even if you try to go easy on the sweetener. They got it just right here!!! A subtle sweet flavor but not too much at all. It was probably the best milk tea I have had in the valley so far. Boba was perfect as well. You've got to try this spot if you like boba/tea!!!!\n",

Not only is this treat super cute, it was sooooo delicious. If you've never had a bubble waffle before, it's more waffle than cone but has a similar flavor and compliments the ice cream nicely. The strawberry topping was plentiful and fresh, just a great treat on a hot day. Two scoops leaves you with a pretty big waffle, the two of us could barely finish the entire thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing was more than reasonable. $2.99 for a waffle and scoop of ice cream, then $.50 for each topping. Boba and tea was around $4. Such a treat!!! I'm so sad this is far away from my usual area, or perhaps it's a good thing for my wallet and health!\n",

The nice young lady behind the counter kindly ordered for me as it was my first time and she gave me the Asian-Q and i took the brown rice on recommendation of others from Yelp. I didnt want the mixed veg as $2.99 to throw a small serving of veg is a bit much. The chicken was good and cooked well, the rice was tasty and fluffy and certainly a surprised being brown rice, and the sauce which i dont remember the name of was equally as good. And a well cooked over easy egg on top.. yum!\n",

One other thing i would say is that the first 4-5 bites were great as it was new exciting flavor, but toward the end of the bowl it all just tasted a bit muddled... maybe thats just me but its how i felt finishing off my meal.\n",

Not too spicy, but it will definitely creep up on you behind that decadent Asian-Q Sauce. Also, a big kudos to the chef who cooked my food.

The owner was behind the counter and immediately showed us our options after hearing we are vegan.  Like, 6 different flavors.  I ordered my simple vanilla ice cream Root Beer Float right away!  Nooooo Root Beer :(. BUT, he sent another gentleman next door to buy a few.  Tragedy avoided.  He asked how thick or thin I liked it and whether I'd like it blended. Yes, blended.  This is the only way I'll do it from now on.  My husband scored the last vegan brownie.  Amazing.  A \"taste\" of one flavor, 3 scoops of another, AND a vanilla shake.  Holy Moly!  All delicious!

The Rolled Ice Cream line is behind that line, so be aware where you stand. I've ordered ice cream, Rolled Ice Cream, and Boba and all are good.

      "So this past week, I've been going to perfect scoop more than I check in at yelp. I go at least two times in one day or at least once a day. I just can't get enough of their french macroon ice cream sandwich!!! Unhealthy, right? Eventually, I'll get sick of it then come back again once the cravings kick in. Anyways, i know I wrote a bad review but obviously things change since the last time I went. The review is ONLY based on the homemade ice cream and everything on the menu!!! The flavors are just right. You won't be disappointed. That's if you find the right flavor for you. Currently, my fave? Green tea ice cream. I had to knock off one star because they're still \"out of something\" whenever I go. I know it's homemade and everything is made fresh, but it sucks when an ice cream flavor is out. One visit they were out of the macroon shells! The only thing that was left was the taro shell and lemon shell. They are still out of the cake pops. Which is what my baby wanted. There was one flavor that was out as well when I went with my baby brother. It was the banana Nutella ice cream that he wanted to try. Disappointed on his part.\n",

      "Service? \n",
      "I rate the service 2/5 stars. The customer service changes every time I go. I'm pretty sure over time it will get better but just be ready for what comes when you go to perfect scoop. The first time I went this week; it was perfect. I was helped and greeted right away. Left a good tip and It was a quick in and out. The second time I went; it was busy so I was waiting for about ten minutes. Imagine the person behind me? She was waiting about 15min for me and the person in front of me. The person in front of me had seven orders plus three which were mine. So it was a while until I had to pay. It was somewhat dis organized. I'm not surprised that she hasn't even left yet, lol. I'm telling you, it's worth your while. There's not much room for people to wait. Once the line gets longer. Everyone is all crowded up at the door. All in all, it is worth checking out!!! Like I said again from my last review. It's worth checking out if they have everything they say they offer.\n",

We all ended up settling for regular ice cream and dip n dots. I also got 6 macarons, an iced \"coffee\" boba drink in a light bulb cup which honestly tasted like watered down chocolate milk. Which was a downer for me since I did pay $5.30 for it and probably could've made a better one myself wahhh! Another unfortunate thing was that literally none of the macarons were taste satisfying :(((((( $18 for 6 cutesy macarons that are just pretty to look at but not so tasty, yes I'm sad but at least they were pretty for the picture which what seems to be the issue these days lol! I really don't seem to sound like I'm dogging in this business because everything is A1, I just think they need to focus more on quality. The prices did not match with the quality, and in this case looks can be deceiving. I spent a total of $47 (with tip) and just expected a little bit more of a wow factor. \n",

The guy working behind the counter was super friendly and helpful, asked if we wanted to sample anything, i sampled a bunch of stuff, and finally decided on Thai Tea ice cream, which had sort of a caramel taste to it.  Very creamy and smooth, they have waffle cones and green tea waffle cones for just a little additional charge.  I went with the tea theme and got the green tea cone, it was nice i didm't really taste the green tea till i got to the bottom of the cone where the radio of cone to ice cream ratio was greater, but you definitely tasted the green tea.\n",

      "They have some creative flavors (Durian, guava, taro, black sesame, ginger, rum raisin.)  The coconut was really coconutty i was tempted to get it, but i usually get coconut with chocolate and i didn't see any chocolate until i asked about it.  Then he said that they have vegan chocolate.  Which i tried, it was actually good, not as smooth as the regular ice cream but still very good.. it tasted almost exactly like a fudgsicle, both taste and texture.  My friend ended up getting the coconut and vegan chocolate combo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked that they make their own ice cream and that some of their flavors were different than what you'd find at your corporate ice cream shop.  I found it a bit weird that they have vegan flavors but don't list them in the case.  My guess is that it cost more to make and people always sample them just to try for the heck of it.  They also had vegan brownies and vegan ice cream sandwiches too which makes me think that next time I'll order an ice cream sandwich with regular ice cream and vegan cookies.\n",

They're all one size (16 oz I believe) and around $4.50 (can't remember exact price). I LOVE almond milk tea, and theirs is one of the best. Not too sweet, not too milky; a perfect balance. The boba was perfectly cooked as well. Not too hard, not too gooey. Perfect. \n",

Their ice cream is super smooth and creamy and taste exactly like the label. There doesn't seem to be any artificial flavors goin' on in those.\n",

It seems to be family owned since the employees are super chill and relax when customers are there and don't seem to be following strict guidelines. A few visits ago, I ordered boba with a friend and drank it there, but I wanted to bring a scoop of black sesame home to my mom since she loves black sesame.

So it's very limited on what you can get. Smoothies come in one size; large. It may not be a plus for many people but it is for me!!! This is definitely worth my money. The guy behind the counter is really really nice. I tried a couple samples... I wasn't too crazy about the black sesame ice cream a lot of people are raving about. But the pink guava ice cream was pretty good. Then the last one I tried was the thai tea ice cream... The texture is thick. Wasn't that good either. Definitely worth checking out though!!!!\n",

Some are nice and make conversation, while others stand behind the curtain most of the time and set your drink on the counter without even telling you.

Though their hours say they close at 8pm, sometimes boba places will stay open a bit later, as demanded by traffic flow.  So, even though it was after 8, I called and sure enough, they were still open.  LUCK!  If you are craving boba and it's after hours, a 30 second phone call might make your night.\n",

I picked THE STREET. Located in a strip of stores and restaurants behind a service station and sharing a lot with an Oregano's, several Asian restaurants (Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, sushi) and a small Asian market I was impressed by the business housed here. It also sits across the street from Desert Banner Hospital. \n",

      "The place was busy but there was no line at the counter. I was greeted promptly but I knew it was going to take a while to decide. What impressed me is that for many of their shakes and smoothies they use the real fruit and not the premix flavor like many juice/boba shops do. Having read a bit about the diamond ice on Yelp and seeing the picture on the counter I decided on that along with a Honey Milk Tea Smoothie with Boba and Thai Tea with Boba. \n",
      "Yes, this was all for me! \n",

It is shaved ice, topped with fresh cubed melon, pineapple, mango and strawberries. all this is then topped with small chunks of what they called \"rice cake\" which tasted like horchata flavored gummy bears, a generous drizzle of sweetened condensed milk and a dollop of sweet red beans. Next time I will order it without the red beans, while not bad it was just not my thing even though I did finish it with no complaints. \n",

He also helps out by perfecting their Boba drinks as well as organizing the whole place since it was opened. The family actually moved here from San Francisco area.

Both flavors are suppose to be freakishly unnatural green but they were white and completely indistinguishable from either flavor. The pistachio was and still is quite possibly the BEST pistachio flavored ice cream i've ever had. lots of chunks of pistachios in them but the flavor was smooth and natural tasting. Like the tea it was subtle in sweetness but not overpowering. The mint chocolate chip was the same way but didnt have a lot of chocolate chips in it. \n",

      "It's a family owned place that's located in the Korean market complex with Hodori and Asiana. There's a hair salon next to it as well. I've been coming to this location for the past 5 years and I've never been disappointed. It's always been the same sweet older lady behind the counter. You can't go wrong with the ramen and drink combo for $7.50. The ramen that they prepare is delicious and the refreshing drink complements well. It's interesting to just sit there and take in all the graffiti that covers the walls. Every time I walk in, there is new art covering the older stuff, but not once have I witnessed someone drawing though. \n",
      "\n",
      "Story time: Once my friend shook his drink so hard that it flew out of his hand and plopped onto the floor. Mango smoothie was all over the floor as he looked at it with utter dismay. Luckily nothing flew into his ramen. The girl who took our order helped him clean it up, told him not to worry about it, and made him a new mango smoothie for free. She didn't have to do that, but she did. I haven't seen that happen anywhere.\n",

      "My GF gave me the heads up awhile back about the street, I was completely against the idea of boba after attempting to have a decent drink at any one of these other boba cafe's. \n",
      "It's honestly tough for a bland white kid to get a good look in a primarily asian cafe, not to mention a decent batch of boba.\n",
      "\n",
      "But The Street is much different; after my first honey milk tea I can say I was hooked, it was the attention to detail, the fresh fruits bought daily by the owner, and the kind exchange of small talk between whoever is behind the counter that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now almost 2 years and one-daily ritual later I'm still just as amazed by The Street as I was from day one, I've tried other cafe's since but nothing compares to this place. The homely feeling from a first name basis, the corner of space that houses my GF's art, and the strange off-menu drink I've become so accustomed to (try it it's called chewbacca!).\n",

      "Showed up on a Saturday night right before closing, and the place was packed. then i looked around closer and realized that almost no one had any food or drinks in front of them, and there was only one person (I am assuming the owner) working behind the counter. guess that explained the patrons sitting around empty-handed.  We ordered, and there was about a 20 minute wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a diamond ice, which was actually pretty good. I was surprised by the quality of the fruit, and the fine-ness of the ice (I know that's not a real word). Very smooth until the end, just a couple of clumps.\n",

I got the blended mocha boba and my boyfriend got the cookies and cream.  I tried both and they were both delicious.  The only thing missing was the cute little lids, they just put them in regular plastic cups.  They're also a tad bit pricey for me to do on a regular basis, but it's the perfect treat.\n",

With the many boba tea places in town, I think that excellent customer service is what sets Bover apart. Oh, and they have soft serve ice cream too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Their soft serve ice cream flavors change every so often. I've tried ube, uji matcha, Thai tea, and Nutella. If you can't make up your mind, get the swirl. Choose the toppings you want: wafers, cookies, mochi, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a smaller selection of boba milk teas and other drinks but they do them well. I've had their Thai boba milk tea, jasmine boba milk tea, and boba milk tea. But my favorite is their crystal white grape boba drink (or something like that). The boba has the perfect texture and consistency. Warm, chewy and soft boba in your cold drink.\n",

A lot of bubble tea places are so stingy, which really kills the customer's experience and gives them a bad image, but here it's cheap (even with tax included), quick and there's no extra charge for tapioca. They make their drinks (at least the smoothies and slushies) from frozen, already-made mixes that are in the takeout cups. At least from what I see behind the counter lol. So that's fine, nothing from powder!\n",

      "What's best about KungFu and what sets it apart from Steepery is that their menu gives you the option to customize the sweetness of your drink, as well as the amount of ice. My complaint with bubble tea is the mystery behind the drink's sugar content, and KungFu eradicates this fear by allowing you to opt for little sugar, less sugar, half sugar, lite sugar, etc. \n",

We once time called ahead to check their hours and they called us back an hour later to inform us that they were out of something on the menu. Over the top thoughtfulness. Great bubble tea as well. Pleasant surprise. The tea and flavors are are made with authentic ingredients, just not sugar and concentrates.\n",

      "People have been telling me to go here and I'm glad I did. From the moment I walked in I was greeted by their friendly staff. The lady behind the counter took the time to go over the menu with me. The word Banh Mi is Vietnamese for \"bread.\" I decided to choose the Banh Mi \"Bo Kho\" which is their version of beef stew. She told me I could have it with rice or a baguette. I chose the baguette.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having heard how good the spring rolls were I decided to order that as a side. You have a choice of either shrimp, tofu or veggie summer rolls is what they call it. I went with their recommendation and ordered the tofu rolls. I was told they take a little longer because they are made fresh daily and right on the spot. \n",
      "\n",
      "I passed on the bubble tea and ordered green tea instead. I was told that their 3 standard teas (green, black, and oolong) are all organic. I gave them my name and was told to sit down. They have a small but very nice upstairs dining area to get away from the cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got my Bo Kho I was floored that I got a baguette almost as long as a small long French bread! That thing was huge!  All that for only $8.50. The baguette was made for dipping in the sweet sauce it came in. The entree had large beef chunks along with large chunky carrots. It was literally so good I nearly made a mess of myself but had enough napkins to handle the overflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to the summer rolls. They were indeed fresh and wrapped in a thin liner. The dipping sauce that came with it I later learned was actually peanut butter drenched with hoisin sauce! It's amazing what different ways places use peanut butter. This sauce was spot on and believe me I would recommend these rolls to anyone who comes. You get two nice sized rolls for only $4.95.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was chatting with the folks at the next table. The lady had the pork and roll on a baguette which was pork shoulder, maple syrup, and spices. She loved every bit of it.\n",

      "If you aren't into sandwiches they offer rice bowls. With whatever meat you choose you get steamed jasmine rice, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and Vietnamese scallion oil. Pretty much everything is under $10.00 so you can get a good meal at a reasonable cost. Take out is also available.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as beverages go, in addition to regular and bubble tea, you can get Vietnamese coffee and sugar cane juice. I'm not sure if they sell bagged coffee but I noticed that some were set up that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have plenty of options to choose from. The chicken, by the way is thigh meat. While I was dining a person came around and made sure I was doing well.

      "Loved this place.  We had a wonderful no-frills bahn mi shop in Portland, ME, that I miss terribly (you know, only cash, knew what you wanted because you were a regular--didn't even need to ask).  This place one-upped it on friendliness.  The staff was amazing and very kind with suggestions.  We got the Lemongrass Chicken and Maple pulled Pork sandwiches (names have escaped me).  They were topped with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro, and I would have happily had those doubled.  The pork was a little tough to chew, but my MIL and husband enjoyed the Chix. We also got boba tea, I had mango and husband had strawberry. The bobas were a little overcooked and stuck to each other in the bottom. A stray one may have nearly killed my husband by choking (we have life insurance policy, so no worries).  The store is located in the now-bustling Lawrenceville and opened late-morning on a weekday.  The inside is narrow, but expands to some seating in the back, up a few stairs.  We sat on stools at the counter while we awaited our order.  It was clean, more modern/contemporary decor, and menu easy to read behind the counter.  Service was amazing and I hope that stays!  I haven't tried other places in Pittsburgh, and if none compare, I'll happily return and review accordingly.   But, certainly, I recommend you stop in.  At least get a boba tea.\n",

All the drinks were made from scratch with no powders! I loved the white peach, not too strong but definitely not weak either. The jasmine tea was your basic jasmine latte. My boyfriend really liked the plum black tea but it was too strong for my preference. The lady behind of the counter also gave us a sample of the taro smoothie; it was BOMB. She told us that the drink was made from real taro that she got from china town, LOL. \n",

They always bring the drink to me as I am waiting and ask if the drink is to my desired taste which is much appreciated. I always try to try something new but you cannot go wrong with the fresh matcha they have. \n",

There were at least 7 people working behind the counter at the same time on Saturday afternoon. Some of them would walk back in the back room to get more ingredients. That makes the service really fast. There is some space in front of the restaurant. I hope they put out some tables and chairs soon so we could sit outside in a nice day.\n",

They have a great variety of flavors and boba to choose from. When I asked a question about their lychee jelly the lady behind the counter really quickly offered me a sample. She had great recommendations based on their most popular drinks. \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried the rose flavored green tea with lychee jelly and really loved it. 25% sweetness was perfect for me, but I have a crazy sweet tooth. If sugar isn't absolutely your thing, I would recommend 0%. (Definitely going to try 0 next time, will update this when I try it.) \n",

      "I visited today with my father and sister. My father complimented how well-decorated the atmosphere is. My sister also gave props to Tuxedo Commons' cameo in the store. Their pricing was very generous on my wallet, $2.99 for a regular sized milk tea! Today they appeared to be understaffed; we only saw one employee behind the counter preparing everyone's orders. She did make a mistake with the order; I ordered a large strawberry milk tea for my father, but a regular sized one was prepared. I won't hold that against her, because I did make a tall order and she took the time to correct it. The sound of her mixing milk teas was like a choir of angels to my ears. I have a lot of respect for shops that take the time to prepare their tea, instead of lazily blending a powder or syrup drink on ice. I ordered milk tea and a taro smoothie to take home for the others and a Yogiberry for myself. When I asked my recipients to let me try the milk tea, you could literally taste the tea and it wasn't too sweet, just right. The Yogiberry was so delicious, even when burping I could still taste the yogurt and strawberry. I look forward to trying their agar jelly (which was not available when I visited), osmanthus milk tea, earl grey milk tea, matcha milk tea, and the special drink by the name of 'Grand Canyon'. I also appreciate the woman behind the counter for filling the drink all the way to the top and letting me earn my money's worth.\n",

      "I walked in today and ordered the osmanthus milk tea, which was on my list of to try for TeaStreet. Unfortunately they did not have Grand Canyon today and like last time, no agar jelly. Osmanthus milk tea had a delicious floral flavor balanced by the taste of the tea. My mother thought it tasted too sweet, so I recommend getting it less sweet. Rachel, the woman behind the counter that took my order last time and this time prepared it handily and quick and was polite over the phone when I asked her about sweeteners for the drinks.\n",
      " \n",
      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "The drinks here are great since they're freshly brewed and you can taste the tea, but the girl working had to hustle to get all drinks made and take the orders at the same time. It just takes so long since there are a lot of people waiting. I felt bad ordering six drinks while she already had other drinks ordered that she didn't make yet with a group of people in line behind me. It took a while for her to take my order since she's working alone and busy making previous orders. They should hire at least two people at any given time. One to take orders and another to make drinks.\n",

The chicken was fried to perfection and the orange beef was very tasty. We loved this dish. The other dish ordered was mango fried rice w/cashew and shredded dry pork. We were informed that they ran out of shredded pork, so we had Chinese sausage instead. The fried rice was lack of flavor and too moist. This is why I'm not giving 5 stars. We chose to dine in and their service really is 5 stars. This place has fairly extensive drink options. You definitely will find something you like. We will return in the future.\n",

      "They're only in their soft opening phase, but this is a set-in-stone recommendation: you should go here instead of that disgrace called \"Rolled Ice Cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Flavyours is a brand spankin' new business on Spring Mountain next to long-time fixture Sura BBQ Buffet and new foodie darling Sparrow + Wolf. Boasting that they discovered rolled ice cream while traveling in Thailand and spent months there learning the art of making this street food treat, they convinced me to give this fad another try despite my disappointment at the pioneering local chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man who appears to be the owner helped me work my way through my order after I decided to build it from the ground up instead of picking a preset combination. The menu is a bit clumsy and incomplete, but there seems to be only one size of rolled ice cream ($6.00). But you'll get to customize the rest:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Ice cream base (house cream, chocolate, taro, Thai tea, green tea, hazelnut, cappuccino, pina colada, and apparently pandan)\n",
      "(2) Mix-in (too many to list, but several cereals, cookies, and fruits are available)\n",
      "(3) Up to three free toppings ($0.50 each for extra, even more options)\n",
      "(4) Sauce (current menu omitted lime and raspberry but did have chocolate, condensed milk, strawberry, kiwi, Nutella, caramel, and salted caramel)\n",
      "(5) Whipped cream if desired. You won't need it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "They don't really play up the \"show\" aspect, although I was free to stand behind the glass barrier and watch the preparation process. After they measure out the base, they'll add the mix-to the base and use a blender to ensure that the mix-in's flavor is evenly distributed. No wonder the owner was so insistent that I didn't use the dragon fruit topping as a mix-in for the green tea flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the process is familiar, at least to me. They'll pour the mixture onto a super-cold flat metal surface, clump it up after initial freezing, spread it out into a very thin layer, and use a metal hand tool to cut and roll the layer into several spirals. Assembly with tongs, toppings, and sauce follow, and they call out your number when it's all finished. Don't forget to grab a colorful plastic spoon before sitting down.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I'd factor in the difficulty of working with coffee tables, which are at tush-level and force you to pick up the cups, rather than typical tables/counters, which we all know are at elbow level, but reportedly they're still waiting on some furnishings. We'll see how that goes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The product is far superior to the other place. My rolled ice cream had all the creaminess of traditional ice cream and it actually has tons of flavor. The green tea base tasted as I'd hoped, and the lychee mix-in tasted of real lychee fruit. The giveaway there is that they accidentally substituted out grass jelly with lychee bits, so I got to taste the product for myself. The other toppings were also good, with lots of chewy mochi, nice dragon fruit texture (not sure what the colorful sauce was, considering that the fruit's flesh is white), and the essence of raspberry in the sauce-from-a-bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what your go-to ice cream spot is on Spring Mountain, but I can definitely foresee Flavyours becoming mine. They'll also add milk tea when they have their grand opening next weekend. I actually did sample some jasmine milk tea, which is promising and reminded me somewhat of Tea Space, but I won't factor that into my review until they officially add it to the menu. Regardless, this place serves legit ice cream, not just a show and a desire for something more.\n",

      "Love this boba spot. The ambience is great and the people behind the counter are awesome. As huge boba fan, i still get indecisive when it comes to ordering that perfect flavor. They see it in my eyes and are more then willing to help a guy out. Huge selection to choose from of course and that also includes the perfect  selection of solid food to munch on. Not that big of a coffee fan to hangout at Starbucks to read, but can see myself chilling hear for a read or getting work done. Cant Lie, I was pretty excited they had a punch card...I will definitely be getting my share of free boba. Cant stress how awesome they do that. Happy to of found this place for sure.\n",

      "I have been so depressed about the lack of boba around Glendale, I think I have literally tried every milk tea at every asian restaurant, market, bakery in this area and all were no bueno! Watered down, powdered, too sweet, not sweet enough.. ARGH!\n",
      "\n",
      "But this place is not only totally trendy with its red, gold and green paint, cute quotes on the wall, funky furniture, and hip hop music playing in the background... they also have good boba! Snacks too! SOOOO many options! And to top it all off, wonderful service!\n",

      "I got the honey black milk tea, my friend got the green tea with lychee jelly, and we got an order of popcorn chicken. My friend's tea was delicious, not too sweet and the lychee jelly was the real deal. You can tell they use real tea; it does not taste watered down. I'm used to popcorn chicken served with chilli powder in a bag with an oversized toothpick, but Bomboba's idea of chicken is served on a tray with a side of sweet and sour sauce and veggies. Think mini chicken tenders. Tasty (and probably healthier too) and priced fairly. My drink initially came out under-sweetened but I asked the person behind the counter to add a bit more honey and they fixed it for me, no questions asked. Someone even approached our table later and asked if everything was to my liking now, and it sure was! I like that they blend and not just shake their drinks before adding ice (even their milk teas). It makes the consistency of the tea a little frothier which I love. They also have frozen yogurt with all the topping options and some other yummy eats on their menu like eggrolls, spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, etc. \n",

The decor was nice and clean. The chalk art on the wall is a unique touch.

Detractors may point out that service may be a little slow, there's an awkward placement of a couch and a few chairs like an unfinished room in terms of the seating area, and there are no options for food/dessert, but these can all be overcome in due time.  I admire the fact that they have a clear identity and focus on letting their product do the talking at the outset since that will ultimate build loyalty and generate buzz in the long run.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The slightly longer wait time is well worth it since the folks behind the counter are intent on crafting the perfect drink much like a seasoned mixologist serving individually tailored cocktails.  I appreciated the owner explaining the various options and inquiring about the level of desired sweetness since I've had it bad on both extremes at other shops.  Aside from passion fruit, fresh fruit and juices are used and there are some innovative add-ons such as taro pudding and sesame boba, as well as specialty drinks using japanese yogurt (Yakult) and condensed milk (ice milk).  I ordered a grapefruit yogurt drink blended with green tea and boba.   Having received my drink after a nice few shakes by the owner akin to a well-mixed martini, the boba was not only at the desired level of QQ (QQ is the Taiwanese phrase equivalent of \"al dente\"), but was also infused with a touch of honey to balance the tartness of the grapefruit, the subtle bitterness of the green tea and rounded out nicely with the yogurt.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Contrast this to my experience at No 1 Boba where I ordered a mango slush with boba and I ended up with an under-sweetened concoction of unripe mango, flavorless boba accompanied by an undesirably warm dark ooze with each sip (presumably the congealed fluid that the boba had been sitting in), and there's really no contest whose boba reigns supreme in Henderson.  For those keeping score, QQ Boba is Germany and No 1 Boba is Brazil: game, set, match.\n",

The sweetness comes through when you chew on them - way better than places that decide not to boil the tapioca in any sweetener whatsoever. Surprisingly, the taro had a ton of natural flavor coming through. It didn't taste like the standard, cheap sugar powder I expect to be shaken in with the lactaid, it really tasted like taro root. Cool. \n",

Another time I got the last serving and a lady also came in and expressed her disappointment that it was her third time also missing out on boba.

I really wanted the sesame because that's such an uncommon bbt flavor. The girl recommended matcha with it and to add the original tube for \"extra creamy\" flavor. THOSE 2 FLAVORS GO SO WELL TOGETHER. Ordered it with a green tea base. Seriously guys...the experience is super unique, but the drinks are also really tasty. Quite pricy but worth it in my opinion.

The one pastry I would recommend out of the three we tried, was the CHOCOLATE GANACHE TART. It was a larger portion than the rest and it had a chocolate shortbread crust, with fudge and more chocolate mousse on top, garnished with a gold flake. Next, the PISTACHIO TART. Chocolate and pistachio gel on top, with raspberry mousse inside. Okay, not great. Expensive for the size, but many pastry shops like this are. Last of the pastries, the ROSE-RASPBERRY MACARON... This too was okay, but it's best to save your money for the coffees or snow fluff. It wasn't special, but at least it had the crunchy outer shell and chewy inner shell. \n",

Would looove to order this again. Next, the STRAWBERRY SENSATION SNOW FLUFF... Like I said above, this thing was created for Godzilla's babies. Huge portion to keep our table of 5 satisfied, and even have 1/3 left. It came with panna cotta, fresh strawberries, strawberry ice cream & strawberry syrup. We love strawberries so this was great. The ice cream was okay and tasted like regular store-bought, but the strawberries were perfectly ripe and panna cotta gave the creamy factor the snow fluff needed. \n",

      "Their menu is pretty interesting as it has fruit based drinks and smoothies (real ones!) in addition to the typical black tea ones.  Seeing how everyone was ordering a smoothie or slushie, this is probably the best ones and stick to the left side of the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mango Diamond Slush - Looking at my cup, I saw the bottom quarter just cubes of mangoes.. happy? Oh yes.  This is by far the most I've seen in any cup and I just seen them cut up 5 mangoes to be used.  This is as fresh as you can get.  I do have to laugh a bit when I saw the diamond mango slush showing the bubbles in it as if it's included... please note, it's not.  It's an extra $0.70 ... not much but it feels a little deceiving that it looks like it's part of it.  The drink itself is quite rich and creamy with all the well blended mangoes and ice.  It is a touch sweet but I think thats from the boba itself.  Overall, it is an expensive cup but honestly one of the better ones in mall and possibly Mississauga.  4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry Banana Slush - Another fruit based drink that actually tasted like the fruit instead of some sugary frozen concentrated version.  I liked how you can taste the bananas and strawberries.  It's a bit richer than the mango slush and I think it's cause of the banana.  I think the bananas made this one on the sweeter side in addition to the boba so if you like your slushies sweet, this would be a good choice. 4/5\n",

      "I'd say The Alley has some of the best bubble tea out there. They stay away from the very generic bubble tea flavours you'll find at other chains such as Chatime or Coco. They don't have Taro or Mango, but rather they focus on creating unique milk tea flavours such as the Royal No.9 milk tea or sweet dew milk tea. Not only do the stray away from the norm, but they do it so well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now don't be afraid, there are still safe flavours here such as an Oreo flavoured slush or a guava like juice. I would say if there was one thing they should change it's definitely the names of the drinks. It can be a little confusing to understand what flavour is behind the bubble tea names, but the servers are really knowledgeable and will answer all of your questions. They also have a sample of the day that will carry one of their most popular drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "My personal favourite is the Royal No.9 milk tea, which I think is one of their best selling drinks. It's a blueberry milk tea, that has a really nice blueberry aftertaste while still allowing the milk tea flavour to go through. \n",

Spent $7.50CD to get one of the special Aurora drinks (Northern Lights) but was fooled in to thinking the bottle would be glass (my bad, not necessarily their fault!). Iron Goddess was yummy, not sure what it was. #9 Milk tea was also tasty but nothing special.\n",

      "Ended up getting genmaicha jasmine milk tea with chia seeds, almond milk, 0% sugar and 25% ice. This only comes in large size btw. They used a jasmine tea base and then added genmaicha on top of that (genmicha freshly brewed from loose leaves as I saw them prepare it behind the counter). Props! \n",
      "Without added sugar, the tea tasted really fragrant without being overwhelming, with a hint of nutty flavor and some sweet/creamy taste from the almond milk. \n",

Like imagine Tevana teas, but a larger scale. The menu for the first time can be a little daunting. It's huge with very small print. If you know what you like, you can narrow it down easier, but if you want to read everything, you're gonna need to move to the side, cause there is a lot to read. They have specials on the chalk board behind the register, but what I don't like is you have to ask what's in each one. But despite that, each time I've been here, I've enjoyed my tea. My last one was the romantic tea, it was pleasant, light, and not sugary, which is what I'm looking for. I'd recommend checking this place out!\n",

They had a huge variety of drinks, and allowed you to customize your drink how you liked it; your sugar and ice level. It is also a neat experience to watch them make your drink behind the glass wall. As far as prices go, they are fair and are right around other cafes prices. Wait was also not long at all and the staff was very friendly and helpful. As far as the drinks themselves, they were delicious and had a good amount of boba pearls in them; not skimpy at all. Next time we are in the area, we will be back.\n",

I had a craving for banh mi, but I was really concerned that anything else would disappoint me. I saw Banh Mi Bistro with high ratings, so I decided to give it a shot. I even drove way too far during my lunch break to do it. I am glad that I did!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got here, I was thinking I'd get some spring rolls and a sandwich to get an idea of how good this place is. I ordered the spring rolls and, with the assistance of the guy taking orders, the BMB Special. He said that the BMB Special and one other sandwich are ones that Banh Mi Bistro does differently from other places. When I saw that there was a fried egg involved, I was sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "My food came out, and I immediately began to question how well I'd feel after eating this meal. It wasn't a question of whether I'd finish, just how I'd feel afterwards. The sandwiches are huge! I dug into the spring rolls first. The pork inside them was great, and the overall flavor with the peanut sauce was excellent. I could have made a meal out of these things alone, and considering their size, I don't think it would be too much out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to the sandwich, the scene stealer. There was grilled pork on there, and it was delicious. The cilantro, jalapenos, and other veggies were all excellent. And as I thought it would, the fried egg stole my heart. This is a pretty darn good sandwich, and it made me know that I gotta come back here for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm reserving a fifth star for trying a few more of the sandwiches. Like I said, my expectations for banh mi are pretty darn high, so this place has high standards with which to deal. But I'll be back.\n",

      "We were the only ones in this bistro at 4pm on a friday and the place was extremely clean with contemporary asian decor and friendly staff. The menu is displayed above the counter subway style and theres plenty of variety and something for everybody. I ordered the vegetarian banh mi and springrolls and my husband got the beef and shrimp spring rolls and beef banh mi with xtra meat and a fried egg. \n",
      "\n",
      "These sandwiches are big and packed with fresh ingredients! Flaky fresh baked french bread hugs a combination of pickled vegetables and cilantro with protein of choice and tangy sauce with undertones of cinnamon and asian spices. Mine had lemongrass marinated tofu and it is honestly the best sandwich i have ever had in my life. Umami! My husbands had tender beef cooked a perfect medium rare with creamy yolk from the fried egg seeping into the bread creating its own savory addition. He said it was the best he ever had as well. Spring rolls were still warm showing they were fresh and made to order and had the perfect blend of rice noodles and herbs. Love that they put cilantro and basil in theres. Peanut dipping sauce was creamy and not oversaturated with hoisin sauce like most places. Excellent!! We left not a single crumb behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, i was shocked that this place wasnt packed with people. The food is amazing! I think some  people are unaware of what banh mi is and too scared to go in and find out. Dont be!! This is an affordable and surefire bet and really expands your knowledge on vietnamese food, its not all pho pho pho!

      "\n",
      "Ambiance: Clean, wooden, and street. Clean because it's very minimal and fairly new, wooden because of the reclaimed wood paneling that's increasingly popular at these hip places, and street because of the distinctive graffiti mural along one of the walls. It works. They put in effort to stay current and matches the college town demographic in this area. And wood's cool! \n",

I asked him what \"wintermelon\" was, but he didn't really know, so I decided on a regular-sized taro milk tea with added boba and sea salt cream (60 cents each for add-ons). If you check into Yelp, you get a free size upgrade, so I ended up with a large (24 oz). Additionally, if you're a UNLV student, you get 10% off if you flash them your student ID. Yay, sweet for discounts and upgrades! Instant fan. \n",

      "I also tried the sea salt coffee on another visit, this time with mini boba. These little guys are cute. Same soft consistency as the original-sized boba, but this time, less anxiety of having them be a choking hazard. I prefer mini boba because they seem to hold you over until you finish your drink. The coffee was just okay for me, it wasn't really that potent.\n",

Since I ordered it with light ice, I sweetened it at 80% and it was perfect. I love that you can sweeten it with honey instead of sugar if you'd like. The black boba was a perfect consistency, and the option of a slightly larger white boba is nice. The people behind the counter are always friendly and helpful when it comes to recommendations... I have been a consumer now since last July when they opened and they have always been delicious. Thank you Tea Swirl for your authentic & tastey product.\n",

      "Tea Swirl was an exceptional drink place that I frequently go to. I recommend Tea swirl to anyone who enjoys boba tea or other iced beverages.There is something about Tea Swirl that other boba tea places in  Tempe don't seem to have. As you enter the restaurant the staff greeted me and it allowed me to feel welcome and make my way towards the front counter to order. Tea Swirl is a boba tea shop located right outside of the Arizona State University Tempe campus. There are many different types of drinks they have on the menu, and I haven't ordered a single drink from there that I haven't drank all of.\n",
      " As I came close to the entrance of Tea Swirl upon my first visit I first noticed the colorful decor the had on the front door. The advertising seemed exceptional, and they had advertising on their cups. I opened the door and instantly felt as if I was welcomed into the establishment. I enjoyed the fact that I could see my drink being made behind the counter as I waited. I noticed very many different college students working on projects, which helped me feel as if  I could go in whenever I needed a quiet place to work. I enjoyed the modern music that was being played in the background and that I was able to hear it but it wasn't too powerful where it overtook conversation.The whole process seemed very efficient and I haven't ever had to wait more than a minute or two to get my beverage. \n",
      " As a customer I felt very welcomed by the staff and asked many different questions about the menu so I could order a drink that was just right for me. I really enjoy the special flair they give when giving you your drink because they tip it upside down and shake it. The menu was very vast, and one of the good things about this boba tea shop over many competitors is the many different kinds of boba that they have. At other shops I have been to they only had the traditional black boba which I thought was pretty lame.\n",
      " Another plus to Tea Swirl is that they give samples of new teas that they are going to put onto the menu, and this helped me out last time I went there with my order getting there sample tea. They also seem to cater to an Asian speaking audience as boba tea is originally from Taiwan. They have Mandarin text on there menu to allow native speakers an easier time to order, or understand the menu. \n",
      " From the few times I have been there I felt that Tea Swirl was a very professional establishment and I will enjoy going here for the next few years I am in University. The quality of their drinks was very good. I would recommend this place to anybody who likes milk tea and lemonade, or any drink that they would like boba in. I liked the fact that I could either go in to get a drink quickly, or sit down and meet others for a social occasion. There are many different drinks I am still wanting to try off their menu but my favorite so far is the original House Milk Tea.\n",

I've come here a few times and each time there's been plenty of seating, kind workers behind the bar, and my drinks have been enjoyable. I really like their Thai tea, I wouldn't quite recommend their taro drink. I came with a free drink coupon once and they very kindly accepted it! I know there are better boba places in Arizona, but near ASU? Tea Swirl is a good bet! Overall, happy with the experience!\n",

      "Finally, a shop near ASU that sells authentic Taiwanese boba milk tea for a reasonable price! The other places selling boba near campus either depend too heavily on powder or don't have the flavor of milk tea down and are too pricey. From what I could see, the tea is brewed in advance, but makes for convenient and quick service. I ordered the House Swirl Milk Tea and the Earl Grey Swirl Milk Tea with 100% sweetness. Compared to another shop across town, their earl grey milk tea tasted more like earl grey, which I appreciate them getting the flavor correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "The customer service is perfect. The man behind the counter was polite and very helpful in making my orders. I received my first drink from behind the counter, but for my second drink, he delivered it to the table I was sitting at.\n",
      "\n",
      "They don't have much for decoration/ambience, but I won't hold that against them because they are brand new, they excel in their drinks, and there is plenty of seating. I saw that they used a powder mix for their Taro Swirl Milk Tea, but I'm willing to excuse that because apart from Okinawa Milk Tea, those are the only two drinks using powder and because it's difficult to make taro milk tea using fresh taro. They also did not have boba today, but that's okay for me because I don't normally order boba in my drinks due to my braces. This place is entirely worth the walk.\n",

      "\n",
      "They're always fully staffed, who's  quick to make whatever you order. They kinda look like their dancing behind the counter with how perfectly they work around each other!

      "OMG. The best Boba in Vegas not to mention incredible service. We went in as newbies and the team behind the counter spent time helping me with my decision. We ended up ordering two crepes (delish!), an Okinawa milk tea with sea salt and boba and a jasmine milk tea with sea salt and boba (the last drink my drink). They warned me that r would be extra creamy and that it was... still delicious, but just very very creamy. It must have been the owner that noticed, but I probably had a look of discontent on my face. Not to mention I was gulping down my husbands drink. Completely out of the blue, the owner or manager came up to me with a new drink. A jasmine latte with boba and said that's how the drink should be if you add sea salt. The tea was so flavorful and delicious! It's really that small gesture that earned this place five stars. Well let's be real... I would have given them five stars because the drinks are incredible and the crepes are delicious, but I am such a fan of places that really take care of their customers. We're not from Vegas, but this is our go to place from now on for boba. And we've been back three times since our first visit so you can tell we're fans. \n",

I'm happy that OMG opened up in my gf's hood because it eliminates those days of having to drive to Chinatown to get my boba fix.  OMG hasn't been around long and they will soon have snow slush.  In the meantime, you can smoothies and slush with a plethora of flavors. My drink of choice...just an iced coffee or a hot coffee with boba.  This has also been the only thing that I ever get here.

I walked in and was quickly greeted, the man behind the counter came over, handed me a menu & went over it with me after he asked if I had been before, which I thought was awesome, he also explained they guarantee you will like the drink or they will remake it, which is awesome they seem to really care about their product. I ordered a lychee peachy green tea with boba, & when they handed it to me, told me to go let them know if any adjustments needed to be made. Their customer service is amazing and I was only in there for 4 minutes. The tea of course was amazing, so tasty & I can't wait to go back and try so many more things!\n",

They have an extensive sandwich selections accompany with some light appetizers. \n",

I tried the green tea with lychee and mangoes with jelly. Gosh, it was really good. I should have gotten another one for the road. Most of the time I cannot finish my tea, but with this place I drank and ate all of the fruits because it was cut small enough to go thru the big straw. \n",

Only down-side is I paid $4.45 for a small iced tea with boba, seems to me to be on the expensive side but I guess the convenient location to my house and the prompt service countered that.

After ordering the $8.50 Pork Thai Basil lunch received a small cup of spicy Tom Yam mushroom soup, a very small crispy roll with a spicy sweet and sour dip, and a pretty small medium spicy serving of Thai Basil that was about 50% bell peppers.  Everything was served piping hot.  No problems with wait times but one person ahead of me left and a couple behind me was told that there might be a 45 minute wait.  Only one visible employee who was taking orders in person and on the phone, waiting all of the tables, and managing the takeout orders.

He was the host, waiter and cashier. I am unsure if he was also the cook. He was a pleasant gentleman. Now to the best part- the food. The potstickers were fresh. Our entrees were so good and portions were big and reasonably priced. Also pleasantly flavorful!!! I got the mango boba and let me tell you that it is not a sugary syrup drink which I was so happy about...it was so yummy! We plan on returning to try other menu items.

I was glad that I trusted her because my drink came out just the way I wanted. The first sip tasted like green tea with a hint of the grapefruit and lime. I wanted a delicious and refreshing drink and that is exactly what I got. My drink was also not diluted and there was a good amount of ice to keep my drink chilled. \n",

      "The \"build your own sushi\" aspect is pretty novel.  First you choose a protein.  Then  you get a choice of two vegetables.  Your chef will then roll your sushi for you and then allow you to choose two sauces and one topping.  The sushi doesn't have to be raw - there are cooked proteins, which include shrimp, crab, chicken, beef, and tofu.  Enough vegetable options are available for you to build most of your favorite rolls.  Toppings include tempura flakes, fried onions, sesame seed, and kimchi.  Also, you're not limited to the number of items I mentioned - add even more variety for a very marginal surcharge.\n",

I would rate fish quality slightly above supermarket quality - you're not going to get Jiro's here, but for around $8, the food exceeds expectations.  There's a lot of people behind the counter and I also observed some confusion between orders - so I guess efficiency in food prep could be improved.  I also sampled the chicken teriyaki.   It reminded me of the chicken teriyaki you get in the mall food court, but it was still tasty.\n",

Until I visited the rainbow location and my number was already in the rewards program.  So the very first time at brew tea, there was hardly anyone there.  I believe they were the owners and the others behind the counter.   Were super enthusiastic and patient, telling me all about various drinks and endless possibilities.

Coming from Vancouver, we have a lot of high quality bubble tea shops, so we had high expectations of what Brew Tea Bar could offer. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the staff behind the counter. The shop was spacious but they only had a handful of seats available. The cashier was very helpful when I had questions regarding their drinks. I ordered a large mixed fruit tea (half sweet), which was a combination of fresh strawberries, peach and passionfruit syrup with a green tea base. He said that if I was not satisfied with the drink, they would remake the drink for free. Thumbs up to that. \n",
      "\n",
      "The drink didn't take long to come at all. The drink was ready by the time I put the change and receipt into my wallet. My mixed fruit tea was so refreshing right down to my soul. They used honey as their sweetener and the half sweet was just the right amount of sweetness for me. I could really taste the fresh strawberries in my drink as it wasn't overpowered by the peach and passionfruit syrup. I enjoyed the drink very much. Brew Tea Bar is the shop to visit if you are craving some high quality tea-based drinks.\n",

      "   I have been to this location on several occasions at different times of the day.  What I have noticed that sets therm apart from their competitors is they always seem to have 3 people behind the counter.  Regardless of how long the line is to order things move fast and in a orderly fashion.  The other Boba place near me is a one person show.  Since coming here I haven't went back to the other place.  \n",
      "   Quality is another big difference.  The ingredients and the amazing flavors of their drinks is also a big difference.  The Taro slushy is very tasty but add in the scoop of taro they add and it is in a class all by itself.  I had the Matcha slushy the other day and it was perfection.  They have a sign that says \"If you don't like your drink we will make you another one\".  It is impressive they take such pride in what they serve.\n",
      "  The staff is always friendly and smiling.  You can tell they love what they are doing.  They definitely know how important customer service is and they do a fantastic job!   Additonally, they have a loyalty program that after 10 drinks you get one free.  Their prices are very reasonable and comparable to their competitors.

      "\n",
      "I'll start by saying my jasmine latte (hot) with sea salt cream and pearls was probably one of the best bubble teas I've had, ever, if not the best. One of my companions ordered the taro milk tea (hot) and declared it the best bubble tea she'd ever had. I took a sip and WOW -- fresh taro and perfect amount of sweetness and richness. Bubbles cooked to perfection. Third in our party ordered mango latte (cold) with pearls. He said it was really good as well but I didn't actually get around to trying it. Next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "The tea itself is worthy of 5 stars. However, there's 2 more things to rave about! \n",
      "\n",
      "1) The store, while small, is welcoming, clean, and you get a good vibe the second you walk in the door. It's not loud and tacky and crushed with people (I went at 2pm on Tuesday). Although the is not really a big factor for me when buying bubble tea, Brew Tea Bar was probably offered the most pleasant ordering experience and general environment of all the bubble tea shops I've been to (yes, lots of superlatives in this review, but well-deserved I assure you). \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Perhaps most importantly, or at least equally as important as the taste of the tea itself, the staff are serious about customer service. I witnessed a customer (a regular, maybe -- he seemed on friendly terms with the staff) sip his drink and proceed to request that the tea/sugar ratio be adjusted. The person behind the counter happily dumped some of the drink and added more tea to reduce the sweetness. He then waited for the customer to sip again and nod with satisfaction. A minute after paying for my order, one staff member came over and addressed me by name, just looking to confirm that we actually wanted strawberry latte hot. She explained it was doable but probably wouldn't be the best choice for a hot drink, so we ended up switching to something else. Lord knows how she knew my name -- I was sort of surprised in the moment but realised she must have looked at my credit card. Once the drinks arrived, another staff member personally delivered them to our table (rather than shouting out the order or just leaving it on the counter as is standard practice at many other bubble tea shops). He also told us to try our drinks -- he waited while we did so -- and asked us how we liked them and if they needed any adjustments. Whaaaaaa???? By this point, I was beyond impressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "$15 and some change for 3 delicious teas. Approx. 12 min drive from the strip, but ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT. My only disappointment was that they would be closed by 10pm and we had a show that ended at 9:30pm, meaning I wouldn't be able to go back and try something else. All the better, as drinking two bubble teas in one day is decadent.  \n",

I also notice each time I keep going back, their boba kept getting better and better and better, you can tell they constantly improving themselves, and occasionally you will see them taste their drink to make sure everything taste ok, right now their boba is perfect and I really hope they can stay that way :) When you order a tea drink, they will brew the tea right in front of you then mix with your choice of cream, milk or almond milk without extra charge!  Or you can simply just have a tea drink, which is just as good! They also have drinks with sea salt cream on top to give it some kick, I honestly think they put half and half boba shop in california to shame!!! (half and half is a popular tea boba shop in CA, I didn't like them because they always hide behind their little curtain and doing \"something\" that they don't want you to know, very pretentious, I stopped going there after only a few times, yuck!) Anyway, I'm glad we finally have a authentic tea shop in Vegas that has great drinks, great price, but most importantly, great customer service!!!!  this is the only boba shop I'm taking all my friends and family to now :)\n",

      "This place right here is simply AHHHHMAZING!  The fams and I have been to the Rainbow location and you can bet how excited I was to find out that they were opening up one on this side of town.  The establishment itself is spacious with some seating area on the side.  I especially love the way they decorated the place - simple but contemporary.  Not to mention, the added Halloween decor, it totally gets you into the holiday spirit =)\n",
      "\n",
      "For the drinks...the fams and I have tried quite a few drinks.  If you're a fan of slushy drinks, a few of our favorites are the Cocoberry, Taro slush, and Strawberry Milky slush.  I personally love the Cocoberry.  Its a coconut slush with strawberry swirl.  If you're into slushys that are more tart, you might want to try the Sunset on the Beach.  The husband wasn't much of a fan due to it being to sour for his palate.  But he really enjoyed their Taro slush.  They add fresh taro on top of their slush which made it 10x better.  So if you like taro flavored drinks, do yourself a favor and get theirs.  You won't regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if you're not into slushies and are more of a tea/milk tea drinker they definitely have you covered.  I've tried several of the milk teas, iced teas, and latte teas and so far, no complaints.  I definitely recommend trying their latte teas though.  They're pretty much teas topped with sea salt creme.  The sea salt creme just adds a whole new level of flavor.  It gives it a nice creaminess with a hint of saltiness.  Definitely a must try if you are a tea aficionado.  Now, if you are looking strictly for a milk tea, I definitely recommend their okinawa and hokkaido milk teas.  Once you try both, you gotta ask for the Hoky Yoky (did I spell that right?) with cold brew.  Its a combination of the okinawa and hokkaido milk tea with cold brew.  A HUGE thank you to the lady behind the counter who recommended I try it.    \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I highly recommend this place to get your tea/boba fix.  Probably the BEST this side of town.\n",

      "If it wasn't clear already, BTB is definitely the place to be! I'm not sure if there's any numbers to back it up, but they've got to be one of the fastest reviewed placed in Vegas this year. Only 2 months in to being open, they've gotten well over 100 reviews, and nearly every one is positive. Rightfully so though. My check-ins will show I've probably been here way too much, and we've already started working on our 4th stamp card. I imagine that's nothing compared to some people though, as this place is almost always packed!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from having an excellent product, BTB has some of the best service you can find in this city, by far. Sou, Louis and Dennis are not only extremely passionate about their product, but are dedicated to providing outstanding customer service. It didn't take but a couple times of us coming in here before they knew all of our names, and remembered both mine and Deegan's drink. I know for a fact they are seeing a bunch of people everyday, so little things like that are what people are going to remember. They may not be from Vegas, but they are making this a locals spot like no other. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I mentioned, we've been here a lot and been able to try a good amount from the menu. There are a few things though that I really can't stay away from. The cold brew is absolutely delicious, and BTB is definitely not afraid to make it strong. I've gotten it on it's own to take home, and while it's not the best by itself, the addition of sea salt creme makes it incredibly addicting. Thankfully I don't have near the sensitivity to caffeine as most do and can down a large one of these, with less ice of course, no problem. I like the bold coffee flavor that has virtually no bitterness from being cold brewed, and the addition of sea salt and honey boba makes for what I think is one of the most perfectly balanced boba drinks in town. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to say there other drinks aren't equally as good though. Deegan's favorite drink is the Hokkaido Milk Tea, which is extremely creamy with a caramel/toffee flavor. Their Okinawa Milk Tea and Coffee Milk Tea are two of my other favorites, and I'm even more of a fan of their other Lattes, specifically the Black Tea and Oolong Tea varieties. \n",
      "\n",
      "So far, there hasn't been anything I've tried that I didn't like. And if that just so happens to be the case with your drink, it won't matter much as the guys at BTB will remake it for you anyway. They proudly stand behind their product 100% and if you don't like what you got, they will either adjust it, or get you a new drink without blinking an eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not a fan boba or tea fan, BTB also has fresh made to order crepes. You can watch your crepe being made right after you order it, and while we've only tried one, the \"PB\", it was delicious and recommended. It's packed full of peanut butter, banana and strawberry. The crepe is light, sweet and is even better with an iced cold tea alongside it. You can also customize your crepe like you can the drinks, and make it just how you like.\n",

      "When I see the five stars rating I thought somethings wrong. So I took uber, left the strip came to this place and tried to pistachio green tea milk. The manager took the time to explain to me if it's better with or without sugar.... Service was quick two minutes (then 15 customers invaded the place behind me). When I went to get my milk, they told me \"if it needs adjustment, let us know\". it was excellent. After few minutes, manager came to check on me to make sure I liked it. Upper scale service. I will be ordering another bubble tea before I leave.\n",

      "Never before I have stumbled upon such a delight of a hidden gem. I was wandering  the area in search of desert and my map suggested Tea Snow. Never having tried this place, the sweet girl behind the counter made some recommendations about what items were most popular. I ended up selecting a small green tea ice cream with green tea mochi and mango pieces and a \"house cocktail\" drink. Firstly, I thought the prices were a little costly- but the amount of ice cream they give you is well worth the price. The person ahead of us ordered a medium ice cream for him, his wife and four toddlers. The price also includes two toppings. The house cocktail boba tea drink was mostly fruit. It was really chunky with pieces of lychee- but still rated great.\n",

      "Wow I'm impressed. This is the first time I have Boba. I know, I'm way behind on this great invention! I've been wanting to try it for the longest time but I never had the courage, just because I had no idea what it could taste or feel like in terms of texture. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, my colleague at work decided to treat me to the drink and he said Tea, Snow and Coffee was the best place to try it. There are so many varieties and so many combinations. My colleague asked the guys who worked there what they would suggest for someone who is trying the tea for the first time and the immediate answer was Honey Jasmine tea. They must have seen my hesitation in making a decision because they also said with that, \"and we can give you a sample to try it first\". So I tried it and it was an excellent tasting Jasmine tea! The flavor was great. It wasn't sweet though but they explained that with the addition of honey, it should be sweeter. \n",
      "\n",
      "This drink didn't necessarily come with Boba but it was a good start. So I asked if I could add Boba to and they suggested I add the Kiwi Boba pearls. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tea was served super cold. It tasted even much better with the addition of the honey and Kiwi. I am so glad I have finally tried Boba! For the people who have not tried it yet, I would suggest you do. There are endless options and there would definitely be a flavor and combinations that would suit every taste! Tea, Snow & Coffee definitely had many options to choose from. I will be returning here to try more flavors soon!\n",

      "The coconut slushie with boboa so so SO good on a HOT day.  OK, any day.  It is so freaking warm in the store when you wait for your drink, sorry I needed to list that is a con.

      "I originally visited Brew Tea Bar because I saw some pictures from Michael K and Antonia R of sea salt tea. Sea salt tea? SEA SALT TEA? I haven't had a good one since SoCal! So I MUST go and try this place! \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to try their Oolong Latte, which is their oolong tea with sea salt cream. Their oolong had immense flavor yet not bitter. It was brewed just perfectly. What's great is that it is not diabetes in a cup! It had just the right amount of sweetness to it. However, I think they did put a little bit too much cream in it so once I mixed the whole drink together, the cream covered a lot of the oolong taste. Another good thing though? If you don't like your drink, they can re-make it for you for free. But no, I didn't have them remake it. It's unnecessary. Next time, I will just request less cream in the drink or just don't mix it at all haha!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then last night, I brought some friends with me to try the place. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also had the pleasure of meeting Sous. He knows his stuff and is able to recommend something based on your preferences/wants/desires. He is very knowledgeable about his products as well. He was the one that recommended the roobios for me since I didn't want something heavy since we had just filled up on dinner. It was also good for digestion! \n",
      "\n",
      "With the five of us all together, we got a hokkaido milk tea, 'the brew' milk tea, jasmine milk tea, jasmine latte (sea salt), and a freshly brewed roobios tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hokkaido milk tea is sweet and has a very distinct aroma and taste to it. It has a very milky taste. It's probably not my cup of tea since it is based off of a creamy candy so it can potentially be very sweet. But it is VERY good despite that.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Brew' milk tea is amazing. It is their standard, almost \"regular\" milk tea and it is made with high quality. You can definitely taste the tea in their milk tea. The milk and sugar absolutely does not mask it, which is what I love. A majority of milk tea places in Vegas make that mistake far too often -- by giving you a little bit a tea with a lot of milk and sugar. Either that or it's really watered down. Sure it saves on the costs but it certainly doesn't have my loyalty. \n",
      "\n",
      "The jasmine milk tea is phenomenal. I have been looking for quite some time for an establishment to make jasmine milk tea the correct way -- well, to my taste buds anyways. Ladies and gentlemen, I have found it. I'm not even sure how to describe it. It is THE place to get jasmine milk tea. \n",
      "\n",
      "The jasmine latte is also very good. Just as the jasmine milk tea, the aroma is what wins everyone over. However, you probably shouldn't mix everything all together in the beginning so it doesn't get too milky. \n",
      "\n",
      "The roobios tea. An african tea that gives you the feeling that you're drinking grass jelly with a hint of herbalness at the end. With a tad bit of honey, it is perfect to end the night with. Plus, great for digestion! \n",
      "\n",
      "Brew Tea Bar, in my opinion, would be the #1 spot for any tea related cravings. It is possibly the best place in Vegas to grab some milk teas. The quality that you get is just simply fantastic. Once you walk in, you can see the jars of tea leaves right behind the cashiers. I simply cannot wait to return to try more of their tea based drinks. I'm also waiting for them to have sea salt coffee on the menu :) I am just so happy that I have found a place that I can honestly say that their milk tea is deliciously yummy. AND it's right next to zee boyfriends house SO WIN WIN! \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm a fan of the Alley located at Commerce Gate.  My main gripe is that it's very tiny and cramped.  You're completely relegated to take out unless you want a bunch of people lining up right behind you for the entirety of your stay.  So when my wife told me of a location in Main Street Unionville, I was all in.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the location here is bigger, but it's still on the tiny side.  That being said, it's not cramped at all.  You have 4 full size tables capable of seating 4 each and a patio outside for when the weather is good.  The place also has a very homey feel which I like.  It feels like a cabin more than a tea place if you ask me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Alley doesn't have as much selection as the other tea chains you see out there.  What they have though, they do pretty well.  I have never been disappointed by them.  I tend to try different flavours as much as possible for variety when I come to these places.  Price wise, it what you expect from a place like this.  Nothing stands out as being too expensive or really cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parking can be a bit tricky.  I'm not sure how street parking works at Main Street Unionville either.  There didn't seem to be many cars parked outside so the best parking option is the big lots they have on the other side of the streets.  It's about a good 3-5 minute walk from there to the location.  When the weather is frigid cold, it's not the most fun walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I definitely like this location more than the location at Commerce Gate.  Both are great product wise, but this location gives off a better relaxed feel that's comforting.\n",

      "Don't ask me why I haven't come here earlier, but I've been missing out big time. So I finally made it to The Alley for my bubble tea and OMG. Best milk tea with tapioca I've ever had!!! Although this shop wasn't huge, it's located in a very nice neighbourhood with small boutiques and other restaurants. There were a few chairs and tables set-up, but this particular location was really more like a grab and go kind of place. It probably isn't the best place to get your bubble tea on a cold winter night because there's no parking right outside, but in the summer, it's the perfect location. Many people like to walk their dogs, go for a hike around Two Good Pond, go to the public library or the art gallery and will pass by. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a large Iron Goddess Milk Tea with Tapioca with standard amounts of ice and sugar. If you're someone who enjoys a strong flavoured tea, this one is for you. They use a type of Ooloong tea called Tie Guan Yin for the flavour and it's amazing. The amount of ice and sugar is subjective so I don't want to be telling you how to enjoy your bbt, but the standard amount of sugar is usually a little on the sweeter end. I was also able to get a sip of the Royal No.9 Milk Tea with Tapioca from my friend and it's quite different than your usual milk tea. It had a hint of blueberry in it so it was very unique. The texture of the tapioca was chewy and soft, so it was cooked perfectly. Although I'm a little, okay maybe very, behind in the bbt game, I'm glad I was able to try two of the popular drinks on the menu highly recommended by my friends all in one night. Will definitely be back more often to try the other drinks. Now I can agree with my friends and say that The Alley has the best bubble tea. :)\n",

The location of the store isn't hard to find and the parking lot is huge. Inside, the store is clean and I like how it's decorated for Halloween! Super cute! They have a lot of workers behind the bar so you can expect FAST service. Their menu is vast and is easy to read up front. Their drinks range from slushies, latte teas,  iced teas, milk teas, and fresh brew. My mom had gotten their Hokkaido Milk Tea (75% sweet) with boba and I had gotten their Brew Milk Tea (100% sweet) with boba. They gave a generous amount of ice (not too little/not too much) and their drinks were AMAZING! We had also gotten their classic crepe which contained nutella, bananas, and strawberries. It was delicious and I would definitely recommend! :) Quality drinks and food so you won't be disappointed coming here; no wonder why they're straight up 5-stars!\n",

      "Went here on a very hot summer afternoon after work and wanted to try this new Milk Tea place near my friend's house. It was a good decision. The inside is so decorative and cute. I can really tell the owner out in a lot of time and effort to decorate it. There were word art, wings, and a little corner where you can take adorable Instagram photos. They had little props for you to use too. The workers were nice and the milk tea was very good. I got the Hokkaido Milk Tea with boba and asked for 50% sweetness. It was just right! I also got their egg waffle matcha combo. It came with the egg waffle wrapped in a cone shape, filled with chewy rainbow mochi, two pocky sticks, and a scoop of match ice cream. Since I wasn't going to stay there and eat, I asked them to put the ice cream separately and they did. The wait was a tiny bit long only because of the egg waffle. However, it tasted yummy. Very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too sweet either. The matcha ice cream was the same too. I really enjoy Itea how their desserts and drinks are never too sweet, and if that you can customize them any way you like. After I left the place and almost got to my car, I heard someone calling out behind me. I turned around and it was one of the workers at Itea, running to give me spoons for the egg waffle and ice cream.

The decor was designed with a hip, modernized, teenage setting made for the 21st century.

The store was able to seat about 20, which sounds relatively large, but when you consider that it's 5 tables of 4 seats, it's not that good. Compared to the medium sized Bubble republic which could fit approximately 50(?) and the larger sized bubble tease in heartland which could fit 75ish, this place is miniscule. \n",
      "The layout of the store as well is not the greatest. The door placement causes the line to run straight down the restaurant, where a customer will place an order on the left side of the line, swim through the line to get to the back of the already populated waiting area and  listen carefully through the ambient noise for your order. When you hear your order, you need to fight through:\n",

      "Jokes aside (The elite four weren't really there) it took us about 10 minutes wait time to get our drinks, which I consider to be pretty fast given the large amount of orders. When you get your order you can either choose to find a table on the other side of the line, or leave. Luckily for my girlfriend and I, we were able to find a table to have our drinks at. Seeing as she wasn't feeling well, she ordered a hot Taro milk tea with tapioca, and I wanted to try something new, so I ordered the hazelnut chocolate milk tea. My drink was decent; a chocolate milk with a hint of what I would assume to be hazelnut. I was expecting a Nutella bubble tea, but this was quite good nonetheless.  Her Bubble tea, however, was amazing! It wasn't overly sweet like many other places, and it taro flavour was a lot different from what I am used to. It was a refreshing change of pace. \n",

      "All in all, I'd say that this place is a good place to go if you're looking for an amazing bubble tea to go.  They have a much larger variety of items than other places, so I'll definitely be back to try them out. The small unit plus the busy atmosphere made for a rather stressful visit, but we're here for the food, not the stay.  That said I'd give this place 4/5 for its speedy/friendly service and above par drinks.\n",

      "I would have given more stars if the tapioca pearls were better. They were pretty good but not too much of it.  They are better than the white pearls at Yogurty's..........but not as good as the pearls at  bubble republic.  Bubble Republic (  Crediview Rd) has really good pearls but at  bubble Republic you pay more ( I think there....the small milk tea with pearls is over five bucks but perfect tea plus bubble pearls ( the tapioca)......I did find a pretty cheap bubble tea place.....( because we can't afford 4 dollar drinks everyday) at the corner of Dundas/ Erin Mills....hard to get to?......one block east near Dundas called kitty tea or bubble Kitea. There a small milk tea only cost 3.65.......a large is only 4.15......and the tapioca pearls are better!  And there is just enough ice.....milk tea is cheap there plus pretty good.\n",

Snoh is located in the same plaza as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe (another bookmark I've had since moving into the valley many, many years ago- now I know where it's located, I'm going to have to stop in for a try!)

I spent my first decade, born and raised, in Manila, so I am very familiar with taro (we Tagalogs know it as \"ube\") ice cream, so I had to try Snoh's icy version, and added Green tea to the mix.  My toppings were cubed mango, red mung beans, and black sesame condensed milk.  It took about 8 to 10 minutes, but we had a large group present, and our lively conversations made the wait very easy.  This is what waited for me at the counter when my name was called... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/snoh-ice-shavery-phoenix?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#jyv16LcyCFb3Cz-Q3CkDxg  I have to say that while it didn't look very appetizing (mango cubes didn't present well, and neither did the black sesame drizzle-- why not just pour the milk, let it cascade down the icy landscapes, and just sprinkle roasted black sesame seeds on top?), I loved the taro, red mung bean, and black sesame condensed milk combo.  I thought the condensed milk overpowered the green tea ice, and I wouldn't order that match again.  However, I wouldn't mind having ust green tea ice.  It tasted very fresh and clean-- a great palate cleanser after a great meal.\n",

I was super confused and asked for a sample, which they gave me. It really is similar to cotton candy, which is bizarre.

I'm no expert, but the 'Dimples Milk Tea' was quite good, not overly sweet, and Mango Tea had real mango bitz and natural flavour. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the teas, we ordered some nibbles for the table, such as freshly made Squid Balls and Popcorn Chicken. But the best was this enormous mango pancake stuffed with whipped cream. Easy on the carbs there! All 5 of our shared it and the other items. The Squid ballsz were good, but I noticed no sauce was offered up, which I was surprised as I saw it in other photos. Oh well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service folks I believe are still getting their bearings  towards efficiency. The items were brought out piecemeal and with large time gaps in between, including the drinks. They may have been short staffed, but I did notice other reviews commenting on service. I feel this deficiency can be resolved with increase in staff and training. \n",

      "   If you're an avid tea drinker but are bored with the same 'ol hot or iced options then this is a gold mine of various mouthwatering flavors that you truly can't get anywhere else. I've only had a chance to stop in twice so far but constantly crave their lavender bubble tea; it has a  smooth & light floral taste that'll keep you coming back for more. Due to the high volume of traffic, the young woman working behind the counter brought my friends & I a sample of their cold black sweet tea (It taste just like Sugar Smacks!) for all to enjoy. If you tend to enjoy a slight coffee flavor but nothing like the nasty junk Starbucks produces then this might be up your alley. \n",
      "  They also have yogurt tea! Never before have I ever heard nor come across such an unexpected beverage: the rose yogurt tea has a strong floral scent & taste that is very sweet. My husband tried to steal mine in exchange for the chrysanthemum tea - which isn't floral at all but is sweet & lingering. \n",

Don't give a heavy sigh, look irritated or give customers a feeling that you're bothering them...umm...how about offering suggestions to customers on what is popular? Or helping them out in figuring out what they would like? The Owner of this place should focus training their staff on providing customer service with a smile. The 4 stars is for the cute seating area, music selection and for the yummy snoh flavors, toppings and glaze options! Service is more like 1-2 stars.\n",

      "I have heard of Boba tea and my son and I wanted to try it when we realized it was right by our favorite movie theatre. We walked in and it's an adorable place. They have board games and a cute selfie station. I ordered a large mango black ice tea with mango pearls. It tasted amazing. Just like the seasonal mango tea that I love at Starbucks. The mango pearls were a different sensation and I may not order the pearls again but my son loved it. I think it's an acquired sensation. I wish I could afford to try everything on this menu. The prices were a little high but I didn't mind since it's not something I would pay for daily. It's a special treat. Also, when I was trying to decide what to order, the guy behind the counter made sure to tell me that they do not remake the drinks and no refunds. I am glad I liked my drink because I would have been pissed if I paid $6 for a tea that I didn't want to drink.\n",

We had planned on getting snacks from Urban, but their fryer wasn't working that day. About 45 minutes later, we came back to get the drinks we'd already paid for. There were about 5 customers in line so we got behind them. The lady in the back (a worker, manager or owner) noticed us and gestured to let us know that she would make our order for us so we found a comfy little table to wait. They have a bookcase filled with board/family friendly games and even a little selfie/Polaroid station for added fun. We got our drinks before we even set up our Jenga pieces so we finished the game and then went home. We ordered 1 medium blueberry black tea less sweet w/ boba, 2 large strawberry smoothies w/ boba, 1 large jasmine milk tea less sweet. All were delicious.\n",

They offer milk alternatives for vegans!! I am unable to do the sea salt cream, but I've heard its amazing. My favorite teas are the oolong and jasmine, both made vegan and less sweet. The thai tea was also good, but not my favorite. Their boba is perfect consistency and they always put the perfect amount!  I can not wait to try some of the other teas on the menu;) I will update accordingly after. In the mean time, go try brew tea bar!\n",

The young girl working behind the counter did a good job explaining what everything was. The shaved ice really is the texture of snow. I had coconut milk shaved ice with Oreo topping and condensed milk glaze. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

They have quite a selection, although if you're new to the tea world you might not know what everything is because most items don't have any descriptions. The employees are quite helpful though, so I asked one of the guys behind the counter and he answered all my questions. I ended up going with a Taro Slush with fresh taro added on top. It was quite delightful and not overwhelmingly sweetened, which is great for me! Also, it was quite busy and still I waited for less than 5 min.

This place is hard to find in that it is behind other shops and you park at another restaurant and have to walk through a very desolate, spare little patio area and the signage is not adequate (it seems like you're going into the Nail Bar next door). However, now that we know where it is. We will be back; the service was friendly and the food was very fresh, well prepared and delicious. The teas were a bit too sweet and limeade too sour but the dishes each of us had were very fresh and good. Recommend; there isn't much on this side of town like this; a hidden gem.\n",

They then add the shaved ice and liquid (coconut milk or juice). I don't see how that took 2 minutes when me and my friend were the only ones there. I am not Vietnamese so a lot of stuff was foreign to me but I like to try new things. We got a #1 Bambu Special (coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed, coconut juice) and a #6 (lychee, longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, palm seed, jello, coconut milk), and they were both very good and we got to try a lot of new things.

This is the only place in Vegas ( of all the bubble tea places I've tried ) that has consistently delivered excellent customer service. From the time u enter to the time u exit.

      "If you're not familiar with milk tea or bubble drinks it can be kind of overwhelming as they have a pretty large menu and if you're not fast to place your order the line can pile up behind you and there's not much room to move around because the order counter is right in front of the entrance. So I suggest you step aside if you're having a hard time choosing. I used to be obsessed with taro slush with boba from just about anywhere that was my go to order , and I've had it literally so many places but the taro here is rich in taro flavor ! Now I've ventured out and have experimented  with Milk tea and let me just tell you they have an excellent golden oolong milk tea. The thing I like most about KFT is that their boba has to be the best boba around. It's not overdone and is firm which is what I live about it but the best part is that it has a distinct sweet honey flavor. I just wish it was closer it would be here all the time !\n",

It had a soft and fresh texture. The rest of the team members were also raving about how good they were. My friend also tried a sample of some a Thai iced tea, loved it, and bought one.

Order and then they have 3 or 4 makers in the back constantly churning out the drinks. The lines can get long here as this is the gold Chinatown plaza, but it goes relatively fast with so many people behind the scenes. I had an almond milk tea with added boba and red bean. The tea itself was nice, considering it wasn't milk, and the boba were some of the best. I think I made a mistake with the red bean as it just didn't compliment my drink; they were tasty just not in the drink that I ordered.  My entire bill for a large was $5.14 which included a yelp check-in free topping. This is a little expensive but super filling. One problem I had was that the straws were too small and I had real trouble getting to my toppings. Good boba just not a life-changing boba.\n",

I tried the Oreo Milk Tea with my YELP check in free topping Boba.\n",

In addition to choosing your drink, you can modify its sugar content, from zero sugar to making it more sweet (if you choose wrong, they'll remake it to your liking!).  You can choose to add a topping (even though it sits at the bottom of the cup; it should be a bottoming) as well, including boba, herbal jelly, and different beans.  My go to drink is their White Gourd Green Tea, less sweet, with either boba or jelly.\n",

When ordering you can even adjust the level of sweetness and ice, which are options I only encountered while in Taiwan.

I looked at their hot tea series and noticed they had a fresh taro milk black tea. I love fresh taro drinks ever since my friend tried the chachago one so I got that. I realized after that I originally got the cold one (at the Yonge location) and thought it was too sweet even at 30% sugar. So I asked for no sugar this time and the lady mentioned the taro was a little sweet already so she wouldn't add any sugar.\n",

There's also options to choose your sweetness level, toppings and type of tea. I ordered a Thai Tea with boba and 25% sweetness. Not bad! And the amount of boba they added was a good amount. I was happy with it. \n",

It's a small, busy Taiwanese restaurant. We went for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. Ordered the deep fried salt & pepper squid (a bit too salty, but still good that we ate most of it) and the short ribs w eggplant (very good, although I didn't try the eggplant). He got the lychee green tea (which he loved but I thought was too sweet) and I got the black milk tea w wheat germ (which I loved but he thought was just good, not great). Portions are great; these two dishes were more than enough for two people. The lady who took our order was friendly and adorable.

I usually get milk tea with bubbles when I come here (oolong, black, or green milk tea), but I've also tried their pomelo and grapefruit teas. This place conveniently shares the space with Kenko and offers food, such as teriyaki bowls and sushi, so you can grab a meal while getting your boba fix! The restaurant is pretty spacious so you can usually find somewhere to sit pretty easily. The employees I've encountered here are also friendly and efficient!\n",

The milk teas taste too milky/creamy for my preference, and when I order them less sweet, it just tastes watery (rather than having a strong tea taste, which is what I prefer). Also, the parking lot behind Kung Fu is paid, which is also not ideal. Despite this, Kung Fu Tea is still a decent option for bubble tea in Cleveland, and I'm sure I'll be coming back!\n",

The service area is clean and orderly; they had a wide variety of machines behind the counter that were used (including a shaking one that I've never seen before that looked awesome.)

I ordered a strawberry lemonade green tea and it was good, I could tell that the had actual strawberries in it as opposed to just powder. I also tried the Oolong milk tea and it was really good as well. I'd recommend giving the herbal jellies a try-- I've never had them before but it tasted really good in the Oolong milk tea. \n",

The snow is also tasty; on my first visit I've tried the matcha green tea snow cream and on third visit I've tried the vanilla snow cream. The board games make it a great hangout spot for families and/or friends. I also think Snophie the mascot is adorable and find something endearing when looking at it.

The employees (chefs) are so pleasant!!  I can't wait to come back.  There takeout service is very popular.....I counted at least 18 people who came in and ordered items to go.

      "Confession, I've never had rolled ice cream. To be honest, I'm old fashioned. Only rolling I'm interested in is a scooper rolling my ball of ice cream on to a sugar cone so I can march my merrily behind out the door while licking it, then remind myself to not make eye contact with anyone who walks in my airspace while doing so. Rolled ice cream takes away that fun. No, I don't want my ice cream in a cup. Now that I got that out of the way, yes, I have never had rolled ice cream. I don't think I've been missing out on life either. \n",

Annnd...if you're indecisive, good luck because there's no way you'll be able to make up your mind. We went with the safest option...UBE CRUNCH. Who in this world of hipsterism does not know what ube tastes like? Besides, ordering ube helped us gauge the product better because it is a flavor we are very accustomed to. \n",

      "Needless to say, the flavor was a winner and so was this rolled ice cream thing. It was thick and creamy. That's the old fashion side of me. If the words ICE CREAM is in it, y'all, it should NOT be thin or light or fluffy. They got other like shops that specialize in that kinda stuff. I was quite thankful it was thick and creamy. Another confession, I don't really like ube all that much either. I'm Filipino, ube in its original form used to sit boiled and ready to eat on our kitchen table like it was a banana. I'm just over it. \n",

My large drink survived two days and the flavor was not one bit altered since I had freezed it.\n",

The taro was bomb dot com!!!  So tasty.  Instant top 3 of all-time in my book.  I've also had the stracciatella, jack fruit, and lychee.  All are delicious.  They have a variety of sorbet, gelato, and ice cream all made in house.  I think i will have to visit 10 times just to try all the different flavors.

      "A surprisingly under recognized shop given their nearly 17 years in the local market, Mixers Ice Cream & Boba had been on my 'to try' list ever since I heard that each of their thirty-plus ice creams or gelatos were made in house and with an extensive day of eating already behind me plus two slices of cake from Jerry's serving as 'dinner' there seemed no better way to round out the evening than with a sundae - no less one consisting of traditional Chinese flavors topped with house made mochi in a fresh baked waffle bowl.  A small shop cleverly appointed with cutesy décor and a few traditional packaged candies to go along with an extensive list of boba, frozen confections, waffles, ice cream cakes, and even French fries it was to a small line that I arrived and after a short wait what followed can only be described as plethoric tasting session including sweet cream, butter pecan, jackfruit, lychee, cake batter, cheesecake, ginger, Thai tea, and more before settling on a traditional trio of Taro and Azuki Bean Ice Creams plus Black Seasame Gelato, a scoop of mochi and a spritz of whipped cream adding texture and the entirety of the amalgam impressively well flavored without being overly saccharine in the least.  Perhaps not as 'trendy' as Snowflake - though also serving snow ice - or esoteric as Art of Flavors - though with a much more extensive menu - and featuring lovely service in a pleasant setting there is no doubt in my mind that this will not be my last visit to Mixers; the avocado boba smoothie, red velvet waffle sundae, ice cream cake pops, and churros are all calling.\n",

      "Who knew a former Fantastic Sams' would become a brand new bubble tea/boba teahouse close to Mesa Community College? It has a unique interior, and the television plays music videos in Mandarin Chinese. I stopped in with somebody else to check out this new teashop. We were behind someone else in line, but surprisingly, the man behind the counter made theirs fast. The menu looks pretty ideal for a bubble tea shop, but as a previous reviewer noted, some items need clarification. Although I did not order it, I assume \"Cheese Tea\" would be close to sea salt crema, but I could be wrong. I ordered a large-sized Fancy Milk Tea with boba, while the person with me ordered a medium Hokkaidō Milk Tea without boba. Like the person preceding us in line, we received ours fast. The cups have Boba Tree's unique design on them, however, they use the typical clear cup snap-top lid, rather than the heat-sealed plastic film bubble tea/boba tea shops normally use. Not that it should matter whether they use it or not, because their drinks tasted good. The Fancy Milk Tea, which comes with pudding, had a delicious creamy flavor, not too sweet, and the boba was deliciously chewy. The person with me let me try their Hokkaidō Milk Tea, and it had the toffee caramel flavor down quite nicely. Ice level was also well done. All of the ice in my Fancy Milk Tea melted, while the person with me had a little bit of ice that did not water down their Hokkaidō Milk Tea. I personally like Boba Tree better than the bubble tea/boba shop across the street, The Street Boba Cafe.\n",

      "This place is so cute when you walk in! There are cute little tables with a cosy but casual vibe. Lots of colourful, local art on the wall and fun plush toys (that could use a wash, but still) as well as some games such as Connect 4 to keep you busy while you wait for your order.\n",
      "We were greeted straight away when we walked in and took some menus to browse. There's a good amount of seating separate from the main café that you can use to browse menus or wait for to-go's.\n",

      "It wasn't until I asked about sweetness and whether it could be modified that the server mentioned anything. It's also not clear in the café so just be aware that if you don't want a super sweet drink, that you can opt for less sugar.\n",
      "The drinks themselves were good! The coffee milk tea was perfect and the lavender one was subtle but you could taste the flavour along with the tea too.\n",

      "They have really tasty taiwanese style popcorn chicken, and it's one of my go-tos every time I visit ZenQ. Their drinks selection is very big, so it's always fun trying out new teas. One of their specials is the Monster Shaved Ice, where you can either create your own (picking your own flavours/toppings) or ordering one off the menu. Cute, tasty, but their prices are pretty steep for what you get. It usually costs about $30 per person if you get some food, a drink, and a dessert.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing I've noticed is that they're constantly understaffed. I've waited up to an hour for my order before, because there's only one waiter running around, and one or two people behind the counter. They've always been polite, and are constantly apologizing for the wait, but I feel bad for them because there are always angry customers who aren't patient about the wait.\n",

My husband was hooked at one glance.  We ordered the chicken Banh Mi and the porchetta Banh Mi sandwiches.  Both were outstanding!  The vegetables were lightly pickled, the jalapeños and cilantro were fresh and the baguette perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside.  The bites with the fresh jalapeño definitely had a kick to them but were counter balanced by the pickled vegetables.\n",

I got the pork belly banh mi and it was a nice new change because most places do not have this type. My husband and in-laws got the regular pork, egg rolls, and spring rolls and they were all good. We all tried a variation of the bubble tea/smoothies and were pretty pleased. It is a more modern feel vibe in the restaurant but the food tasted very authentic! Coming from someone who is Vietnamese, trust me on this one. Unfortunately just one banh mi each did not fill us up all the way. Check it out if you're in the area\n",

Their extensive menu includes snacks such as dumplings and even hot pot in addition to coffee,tea, and yogurt!\n",

At the top of the list was the Okinawa coffee with sea salt latte, which was the one I ended up trying. For $0.99 more, you can get a 32 oz. \"regular\" size, which felt like I was drinking a Big Gulp. It was a little on the sweeter side and if I were to order it again, I would get 3/4 sweetness. Other popular drinks on the list include wintermelon, Hokkaido milk tea, and ice milk. \n",

When she gave me the drink, she stated that if the drink is too sweet, they can change it for me. I took a sip of it and it did end up being too sweet for me. I felt so bad asking her to re-make mine 50% sweet, but she was so nice and friendly about it. :) \n",

At first I thought I thought it was going to be regular milk tea, but its like a milk slushy with hot honey boba and pudding in the bottom. You stir and it gets nice and warm. Very sweet and larger than most regular sizes. Sister got the green lemon iced tea no boba. Her's was ok. Unless your drink includes boba, its extra. They also have dairy free soy options.

I tried Volcano Tea once that's right outside, and hated it. Their smoothie tasted artificial and watered down. Here they cut the fruit for your smoothie after you order it, and you see it getting made right behind the counter. There's not much to say after that, what more could you want?

My colleague and I met and she guided me through the process. She highly recommended the boba and the woman behind the counter allowed me to try before I added it to my order. I went with the black tea, lemon flavor, no milk, lychee boba and it tasted like a delicious and fun Arnold Palmer that had the joy of the boba bursts! So, next time I go I may be more open to the other flavors... but, this kind was so good I might stick with it too!\n",

Many of the other places simply use powder or some pre-made mix =(, but number definitely holds it down with some real fruit thrown in the blender. Now don't get me wrong, those giant bags of sugar behind the cash register are not just there for decoration.\n",

      "They have a great selection of smoothies in 4 different sizes. My fave - strawberry and banana actually tastes like what its supposed to. They have plenty of add-ons like green/coffee jelly, boba (of course) and more. The biggest size being about $5 bucks makes it a decent deal compared to the other smoothie shops in Chinatown.\n",
      "\n",
      "No. 1's small shop serves up more than just smoothies and boba. They have a limited selection of Viet sandwiches, and a bulk food section. Most of the bulk food is different Asian delicacies and of course you pay based on weight. \n",

After a few minutes of contemplating the extensive menu, I choose the Watermelon with Boba. Oh my dear lord, I have never had any Boba drink as delicious as that.

      "First timers are most likely going to be drawn to the 'Most popular Bowl' and while that is a solid choice, I prefer the more savory broth that comes with the Hu Tieu (Pronounced Who-Two).

      "Several new bubble tea shops have debuted in the past few months, and Taste Tea is one of them. Las Vegas used to have a pretty stagnant bubble tea scene, but these newcomers have livened it up with generally high-quality offerings. So far, all of the ones that I've tried have been solid and worthy of either a recommendation or a watch-and-see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads me to my rant: why the flying puck aren't any of these new shops opening up in frankly-no-competition-at-all Henderson? I understand the phenomenon where several similar businesses will cluster together has a reason, but there's no reason for this outlier on Flamingo and Hualapai, or the one in Centennial, or the spots on Eastern Ave near Henderson (both of which frankly don't cut it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody, if you're out, there, please: come to Henderson. Preferably somewhere near the Sunset Station area. There are two schools called Roseman and Touro, and they both have health/medical programs that draw hundreds of Asians (read: stereotypical consumers of bubble tea) at least five days a week, and up to seven days for those who live nearby. This can easily form the core of your customer base. Aside from that, you'll get others who will hear about it (on Yelp, duh) and stop by when they're in the area. For those wondering if there are any final steps, yes: \"???\" and \"Profit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I ended up tasting one tea and ordering another. I sampled a lychee oolong, which was a bit sweet and (I was tired at the time, but I'm pretty sure that it) tasted of real lychee. I bought a large Taste Milk Green Tea ($4.25), which per the gentleman behind the counter is \"90%\" jasmine. Although the tea flavor did seem somewhat muted, I could certainly buy some of what he was selling. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I was still a big fan of the drink because it's much richer and creamier than a typical milk tea. It tasted like (and probably is) a milk tea with added cream, and I usually enjoy the bubble teas at other places with cream. Unlike those cream drinks, this didn't have sea salt, but I didn't miss it (although I'd definitely welcome it next time).\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot of open floor space for some reason, but the few tables had student-aged people on laptops, ostensibly studying. Unlike some competitors, this was certainly a quiet enough atmosphere for that sort of thing. Also, note that they have stamp cards (which they offered me without asking).\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure when I'll be back this way, but I'm looking forward to visiting Taste Tea again to test their pearls and try some of their other drinks, perhaps with some adjustments on the ice and sweetness (which I neglected out of fatigue). I'm happy for people in this area that they have some awesome new businesses including this one. I just wish that I could be happy for myself and my neighbors as well.\n",

I got a cookie slush with custard pudding and a hot matcha cream toast, it was all delicious! I have to come back to try all the cool flavors on the menu like pistachio and cloud strawberry. They also have additonal toppings you can add to your slush or Tea. They have free WiFi and this cute little stuffed animal that sits in one of the chairs so it was something nice to see while I enjoyed my food.

We also tried the creme brûlée and the Oreo cheesecake. Everything was really tasty and I definitely want to go back and try the tiramisu in the mini flower pot. They have a patio and inside area.

The sign next to the cashier states that boba comes with drinks, but of course I failed to read that part... D'oh). Anyways, I also requested my drink to be made with 50% sweetener. I liked my drink with the modifications. The drink was perfect at the sweetness level. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lychee Slush, $4.50 tax included- My husband opted for this drink, which it did come with boba. It also did not contain any tea. He also got his drink at 50% sweetner but thought it was still on the sweet side and would probably consider getting it at 25% sweetener in the future. \n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "(Total= $9.50 after tax)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait time for our drinks was rather quick. We were able to try 2 teas that were out for samples (almond milk tea and a flavored rooibos tea). I thought the almond milk tea sample tasted more milk like and didn't really taste much of the tea part. I liked it but some may prefer their almond milk teas to be stronger in tea flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The owner was friendly and was making small talk with us and had informed us that this tea place has been here since the 1990's. \n",
      "\n",
      "I love that this tea place is not hipster and the prices are very affordable. \n",
      "\n",
      "But there is only 2 tables inside so this doesn't encourage patrons to stay and enjoy their drinks here. We were able to snag a table and also poach off of the free WiFi. It is password protected and so the employee behind the counter typed in the password on my husband's phone (it must be a real long and random password that he didn't want to tell us and probably easier for him to type it in). \n",
      "\n",
      "I will definitely be back here the next time I come to Las Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that there are not restrooms here, but if you go down the hall, there are public restrooms in the Chinatown Mall (surprisingly the ladies restroom was decent and adequately stocked with the essentials and had running water and soap).\n",

      "\n",
      "I got the milk tea boba and it was just to my taste as far as milk tea goes. The tea flavor was present and not diluted like some places I've been. Sweetness was just right. Even after some of the ice melted from this scorching day it was still good. The boba itself was slightly softer than I prefer. Not mushy, but I like my boba to have a bit more of a chew to it. A little soft is better than undercooked. The women behind the counter were pleasant and friendly. I would come back for milk tea my next visit to Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also sell crack seed items in the store in large glass jars. I didn't try any of them this time, but maybe next time. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is inside a little mall in Chinatown. Not hard to find. Go into the main entrance and its on the left after the travel shop.\n",

      "We were in the area, and I decided to take Mom and Pop to my favorite Boba joint. I always rotate between Avocado, Taro, and Lychee-Coconut, so I got a Lychee-Coconut, and Mom and Pop shared an Avocado boba smoothie.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't know what to expect, because according to their boba  experiences in Hawaii, they were not impressed. After their first taste, they were hooked and before you know it, it was all gone! As we left, Mom thanked the lady and added \"This is better than what we get in Hawaii!\" I gotta agree, on my trips back home, I haven't come across boba drinks that even come close...\n",
      "\n",
      "We returned again during the Chinese New Year Festival and this time, the line was out the door! Luckily we were able to grab a table among all the chaos.\n",
      "While we were enjoying our boba smoothies, a stomach-twisting stench filled the air, and I see this mom and her baby boy in line about 2 feet away from our table\n",
      "and immediately, I put two and two together and falsely accused this baby of crapping his diaper...Boy, was I WRONG!!! Dude, I honestly thought it was the baby because I couldn't see anything else going on up front because it was PACKED! Guilty by association? My bad!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "A few LOOONG minutes later, the lady behind the counter shouts \"Durian Smoothies!?!? A lady comes up and grabs two Durian boba smoothies **barf sound**\n",
      "Poor person she kissed or talked to after she enjoyed her smoothie...EEEEWWW!\n",

      "I love finding new boba spots but I'm always scared to try something new. So I get a variation of my usual drink: green tea lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Parking was pretty easy, we got a spot right at the front. The front of the Tea of Joy is a cute little area with tables and a patio swing. I'd definitely be coming here more often once the weather starts to warm up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking in, there were no customers... which means I'm not pressured to choose what I want to drink. I got a weird order (matcha slushie with green tea ice cream on top) and everyone behind the counter gave me a weird look so I was a little self-conscious... But four stars because they made the drink perfectly! I was pleased and savored it as long as I could. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have desserts: macarons, tiramisu, creme brûlée... yum! Their menu is pretty diverse. I'd like to try other things but I really want to stick with my drink lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seems like a great place to study because it's not too loud and the tables are big enough to hold textbooks and a laptop. There's a little section with two couches and a tv, yet what was playing just looked like a loop of commercials. There are also games on a shelf to keep yourself entertained.\n",

      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "I give props to Tea of Joy since they open pretty late. There were times that I was craving for boba during 1 in the morning after a long night of clubbing. I love how this place is pet-friendly, because I usually don't like to leave my dog behind. They even have a swing-set if you want to take cute photos for instagram.\n",
      "They offer a wide range of drinks from milk teas to smoothies. However, their drinks are a bit sweeter, so I recommend getting 50-75% sweetness. As for their desserts, I have only tried their macaroons. I really love the thai tea and lavender. \n",
      "FYI if you want to start a stamp card, save your receipt because they give instructions on how to start one.\n",
      "The service is pretty friendly and they make their drinks in a timely manner.\n",

      " ------------------------------------------------- \n",
      "\n",
      "Products: Their tea is not sweet. I like my teas not sweet/towards the bitter side, so this place is perfect for my taste. The thai green tea is my favorite. The macarons are probably the best ones I've ever had. My boyfriend loves the chocolate one and I like the mango passion fruit. We're waiting for them to start offering their snacks menu! \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: They're learning. They slip up here and there but it's not to the point where it ruins my time there. A lot of people don't understand that during soft openings, the staff are still learning and working out kinks. I'm sure they'll improve over time. They're nice and accommodating, doing what they can at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Place itself: THE ACTUAL LOCATION IS SO HARD TO FIND LOL. I got lost trying to find it the first time because it doesn't have a sign on Spring Mtn, you just literally turn into Magal and the place is right behind it. The interior feels like a living room, with a PS4 and board games to kill some time. Very clean. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I really like this place and I'm looking forward to what they have in store these upcoming months.\n",
