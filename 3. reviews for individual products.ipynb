      "I wa craving for some bbt and decided to try OneZo since they recently opened up a new location near me . I had tried OneZo when they were at the Waterfront Food Festival . But they only had 1 flavour of the tapioca which wa cactus . Despite it being such an odd flavour , I really enjoyed the texture of the tapioca . We came here on a friday night at around 8pm . It wa n't busy , just 2 people ahead of u . It took u some time to decide what we wanted to order since it wa our first time coming to an actual location . They had quite a few variety and the person at the cash wa very nice about u taking our time . We decided to go with the OneZo milk tea and the taro milk tea . The OneZo came with 3 type of tapioca and to be honest , I could n't really taste the different flavour . But the tapioca texture wa very different than any tapioca that I 've had before . It 's chewy but not sticky , almost like a mochi . Very good . The milk tea wa very standard.. I still prefer the milk tea 's from chatime . I found the taro milk tea to be quite powdery , especially if you leave it sitting for a little while . You kind of have to mixed it a little before you drink it every time to prevent that grainy texture when you drink it . Which I thought wa bad , considering how much the drink were . Mid way making our drink one of the employee said they were out of taro tapioca and only ha a little bit left and asked if we mind adding a different flavour we said okay . By the time we got our drink the only tapioca they had left wa mango . And it wa only 8pm ! They do n't close to 11.. hopefully they were cooking some in the back . Both drink together came to $ 13.99 for 2 large . I do think the large size from OneZo is slightly bigger than Chatime and with house made tapioca .. maybe it 's worth the extra few dollar ? That 's up to you to decide . The store itself is very small , just a few table . And where they have the glass to view how they make the tapioca is right in front of where the door is so you really ca n't just stand there to watch a you 'll probably get hit by the door . I thought that wa a bad place to have the door but you can always step outside to see it a well . Overall , I think the tapioca 's texture wa very good and if I 'm ever craving for bbt with tapioca I 'll be sure to go back . But without the tapioca , the drink are just mediocre . \n",

      "The drink were okay but the service wa bad so that 's why I 'm giving this location specifically a 2 star . We ordered the taro milk tea with taro tapioca and the oolong milk tea with sesame tapioca . Both milk tea were yummy but really sweet , even at 50 % sugar . The taro tapioca wa very chewy and delicious , I really enjoyed it . On the other hand , I love black sesame anything but the sesame tapioca wa meh . It wa very hard and tough to chew on . The grittiness made me feel like I wa chewing on wet sand . Now onto the customer service . The guy at the cashier wa really nice but some girl had to come and intrude while he wa doing his job in taking our order and she wa n't very friendly . She made the whole process more complicated than it needed to be . I already checked in and followed their Instagram for the 10 % off before I paid for the drink , and then a I wa paying she noticed I wa n't alone and did not give me the 10 % unless my boyfriend check in too . I do n't get it . I 'm the one ordering the drink and paying for it so ... . On top of that , the nice male cashier wa giving me their stamp card and she jumped in and said he ca n't give it to me because I received the 10 % already - telling me if I 'm taking the stamp card she 's going to remove my discount . I did n't appreciate her constantly pushing the guy away and intruding on her coworker doing his job . She had so much negativity to add to this transaction when it wa n't her job to take my order to begin with . It 's definitely overpriced for what you 're getting , even after the 10 % discount . \n",

I came with five others and we all ordered something different . We got the Hokkaido , Thai , Rose and Matcha milk tea . Out of all those drink only the matcha wa good . The Thai milk tea taste watered down and oddly very orange than normal . The rose milk tea taste like body spray . Very difficult to drink because of how strong the rose is . Lastly , the hokkaido milk tea ha a very thick texture and it taste more like almond milk . Very disappointing ! I do n't plan on coming back . Sorry \n",

      "I love everything about this place and is now my favorite boba place to go to . The environment : Not only wa the atmosphere so relaxing but even the music wa very calming . I would choose this place to study or work on thing I have to work on in a heart beat . The third time I went here I had my friend check the place out with me . I wa able to hear everything she said because the music is not loud at all and trust me that 's a huge thing . I 've been to so many boba place and it 's rare to find a place that ha such soothing music . Customer service : It wa honestly one of the best I 've ever experienced . I 've been here three time already and I always feel so welcomed . They 're always so nice and patient . For my office , it wa my time to get u boba so I called to order and I will tell you , some of my friend are picky ... When I ordered for about 8 people the person on the phone took the time to really understand what I said and got all of them correctly . I told him that I would be there in 10 minute but I got there earlier yet a soon a I got there everything wa done , prepared with label and already . Seriously , three time I 've been here and three time they got my order perfectly . The boba drink itself : I 've gotten two kind of drink for myself . One , a jasmine milk tea with the cap and boba and the other , mango smoothie with boba . Both with almond milk instead of regular milk . Boba quality is chewy and sweet so you can tell that they actually took the time to make it . It 's not how some boba place have their boba a little on the harder side so it take a while longer to chew . Also , the taste wa very fresh for both drink . Although , this may be more subjective . If you like your boba softer all around and actually taste the sweetness then this place is great for you . Other : They have a blackboard in front where you order and it say that they will remake it . They also have another black board placed on the right showing that they will adjust sugar level and milk tea to creamy or le creamy . On the blackboard behind them is their menu and you can choose what kind of milk you want . If you 're lactose intolerant like me then there 's the almond milk option which I always ask for . Of course this will cost extra . Their sign is hard to find because it 's not on the roof but under the shade but it 's close to McDonald 's and you 'll see that their name is on a banner . They have wifi and the password is on anither board . 5/5 without a doubt . \n",

      "Came here on a weekday night , wa n't busy besides the group of girl studying beside u . Cute little Asian inspired cafe with anime looking character on the wall and some cute music . Ordered the pork belly with rice meal , did not expect it to be that huge ! Came in a bento box , so with multiple slot for item . Definitely worth the price ! Pork belly with some special sauce wa definitely a favorite and good choice , wa not too salty or too sweet either . Came with rice , some cabbage in a sauce ( did not expect to like t that much ) . Also ordered a jasmine milk tea with boba , not too bad either . Boba wa cooked nicely , but I just wished they had the usual almond milk tea on the menu , but their drink selection had variety . Last but not least the dessert ! Had the taiyaki ( fish waffle ) filled with ice cream and Nutella filling and marshmallow . The Taiyaki I thought wa pretty good , but then again I never had the real thing in Japan . The filling and ice cream inside were nice touch , ( picture worthy ) but I thought they should 've used the mini marshmallow instead of the big one . Overall definitely a place to try and I would come back . Gon na try their honey toast next ! Hope it doe justice , I 've been trying to find honey toast that is just a good a the one in Hawaii . \n",

      "I really enjoy Loftti from the uniqueness of the interior to the drink themselves . In term of the decor , think of Loftti a the love child of a West Elm and a Crate & Barrel . They went for a glass pane kind of menu board and mid-century modern furniture , and besides the interior , the drink and service were great ! If you 're here to study , they have hanging electrical outlet hanging above the large central table that you can just pull down . There 's outlet next to the blue couch , and two others next to the bookcase in the back . The table are kind of small which is the only downside if you 're looking to study . But hey , it 's a cafe and not a library , so I 'll take it . I did n't try the raindrop cake or the cotton candy dessert , but we had the hot americano and a 16oz white coconut latti ( milk tea ) instead . The americano wa smooth and pretty tasty overall . They do n't specialize in coffee , but if you 're looking for a decent americano , you wo n't be disappointed . It come with a high lid that is supposed to pool the coffee in the lid , and this is supposed to cool down the drink . I thought this wa really novel and something I 've never seen before . The white coconut latti wa amazing . I usually do n't go for any other milk tea besides my usual ( thai iced tea , jasmine milk tea , or almond milk tea ) , but I wa feeling pretty zesty this weekend . This doe n't taste like an artificial coconut flavor but rather , it taste like the real thing . It 's got some density/slight creaminess to it , and it 's a subtle coconut , not an overpowering flavor . The customer service wa great . She wa very friendly and helpful when it came to choosing drink since it wa my first time . Overall , the employee are very nice . All in all , the cafe is beautifully designed/decorated , the employees/staff are accommodating and friendly , and the drink ( especially the white coconut latti/milk tea ) are great . 10/10 would come back if I did n't live so far away . \n",

She 's a sweet small little lady that explained all her drink . She look so proud of her drink . I 'll definitely come back to try more . The price for the split cup are a bit expensive though . \n",

'' I figured I can enjoy a large tea while my toddler nibble on the waffle stick . I ordered the large jasmine milk tea with sea salt cream , which came out in a recyclable glass bottle . I also chose the Nutella a the dip for the waffle stick . My toddler enjoyed it very much . We lounged in the sofa area for little more than half an hour , and it wa very relaxing . She liked the cute mug that were hanging on the wall . My jasmine milk tea wa a bit sweet , so I know next time to order it le sweet . I can still taste the floral and tea , so that is good . The cute Asian girl that took my order wa not a friendly a she could be ... 2nd time - I came in at 8am on a Sunday with my toddler and hubby . He ordered the almond blossom latte while I ordered the butter coffee . My butter coffee wa awesome ... even hubby said he will order one for himself next time .

      "Not sure why this place is n't rated higher.. they have such a huge selection of interesting tea , ranging from sweet to fruity to classic Assam or oolong . I mean the menu is EXTENSIVE and I wanted to try everything . Ended up getting genmaicha jasmine milk tea with chia seed , almond milk , 0 % sugar and 25 % ice . This only come in large size btw . They used a jasmine tea base and then added genmaicha on top of that ( genmicha freshly brewed from loose leaf a I saw them prepare it behind the counter ) . Props ! Without added sugar , the tea tasted really fragrant without being overwhelming , with a hint of nutty flavor and some sweet/creamy taste from the almond milk . Prices lean more on the expensive side for bubble tea- mine wa $ 7-8 for a drink ... and that 's pretty steep . Maybe that 's why their rating are n't a high . But aside from prices.. Customer service wa great ! They did n't mind customizing my order even with a long line of other customer . Usually 3-4 worker behind the counter . Wifi provided , just ask for the password a I did n't find it posted anywhere inside . It 's located in a huge shopping center so you really got ta drive around looking for it , but it 's all the way on the inside , across from peter piper pizza , and near PT Pho Vietnamese restaurant . \n",

      "Yoooooooo this place is my jam . For me , Brew Tea Bar ha always been pretty consistent in term of service and taste . Everything I 've had from here ha been spot on . I honestly do n't think I 've ever had a bad experience from Brew Tea- only good experience ! There are a few table to the right that are great for hanging out with friend or just catching up . There 's ample electrical socket a well , so if you 're looking to study , it 's also a solid option . It can be a little loud during peak hour . If you 're studying and want some background noise but you do n't want a distracting environment , try going at non-peak hour . I 've tried the almond milk tea , hokkaido milk tea , caramel milk tea , and the jasmine milk tea . They 're all so very distinct in flavor , but they 're all well done . The hokkaido milk tea is very fich and sweet , so consider getting it le sweet . The egg pudding and boba topping are amazing . The boba is n't over cooked nor is it too hard/undercooked . They got it jusssttt right . The egg pudding is soft , slightly sweet and custardy . Everything you could ever want from light and creamy egg pudding . Overall , everything I 've ordered from Brew Tea Bar ha been amazing in term of taste , consistency , and sugar level . Just make sure to reduce the sugar level for certain drink like the hokkaido milk tea . If you think your drink is too sweet or not sweet enough , just let them know so they can remake you another one on the house ! \n",

      "While I have n't checked in here nearly a much a I should I do come here regularly . The first thing I will comment on is the place . Generally speaking , a place this good is n't too burdened by it 's parking lot . It 's easy to spot and is open when I need it . Now inside , I love the effort that went into this place . It 's beautiful with it wooden panel on the wall and soft lighting . The setting is professional but also inviting . You feel welcomed at brew tea bar and no one make you feel a if you have to leave immediately . The staff keep the place very clean . People even stay to get work done in there . Yes it can get noisy , but it 's that background noise that help you get work done ! Brew tea bar really stand out because of their staff . This company know how to pick and/or train their employee . I always get recommendation for new drink . As of now my favorite that is recommended is lavender milk tea at 50 % sweetness with almond milk . That help with stress . They also helped me learn about how mate tea help with concentration . The staff really know what they are doing . They never fail to ask me if I need anything else . They truly go beyond what is expected of them . That is something that is pretty uncommon in most place these day . The drink are amazing . I already mentioned my current favorite . However I 'll just state taro , matcha and jasmine milk tea are wonderful a well . If you get overwhelmed by the drink on the menu just ask and the staff will guide you . I never thought I 'd be this interested in tea , but brew tea bar ha changed my mind about that . To put the cherry on top brew tea bar ha a reward program . If you get to ten drink you get a free drink . I believe you just have to give them some info including your phone number . In conclusion give these fella your trust and they wont fail you ; ) \n",

Special thank you to the guy that always offer u a free drink to try ( I should really get your name ? ? ) My favorite combination to make is the Snow White ( jasmine milk tea ) with almond pudding and boba .

The Rose Garden is also DELICIOUS ! If you 're ever in the mood for a sweet , refreshing drink , this is your best friend . Overall , I absolutely adore this place .

My fiancé and I have tried both the almond milk tea and the jasmine milk tea . The almond ha an almost artificial taste to it and I 'm not saying that it 's a bad thing , I 'm just saying it 's not for me . The jasmine milk tea on the other hand , is a home run and is truly enjoyable especially when paired with the egg pudding in place of Boba ( we like our Boba a little firmer and it 's a bit on the soft and chewy side for me to enjoy . ) The staff here are always nice and never make you feel rushed even if you show up 3 minute before closing like I have ( sorry employee I get off work late . ) I am interested in sampling more flavor that they offer during our next visit and I 'll be sure to update my review accordingly .

      "If you follow my review , you 'll know that I 've tried a lot of boba shop and can be very critical , even in Las Vegas . The scene ha developed to the point where it can stand up or even surpass the best of California . Well , I think I really like this place . Think Boba is a new bubble tea shop , currently in a soft opening phase ( and still waiting for more furniture and possibly trash receptacle ) . It 's on southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Maryland and occupies a spot between Zabas and Wabi-Sabi Vapor . The owner is a proud daily drinker of milk tea , even frequenting another nearby store while he wa between closing Milk Teaze ( a long-lived business in a high-turnover food town ) and opening this new , more family-friendly venture . He make all his tea from loose leaf and all of his syrup from the actual ingredient , except for a few which he 'll show you still use `` natural flavor '' ( caramel , almond , and coconut ) . Drinks are $ 3.95 for small size ( 16 oz ) and $ 4.95 for large size ( 24 oz ) and there 's a buy 10 get 1 `` stamp '' card built into the point of sale system . It 's those fruit flavor which I 'm most excited about . I 've been burned a lot by artificial fruit flavor , but the passion fruit slush taste exactly like if you took a real passion fruit , cut open the inside , strained the seed , and ( heavily ) sweetened the product . It 's really dang good . Mango and lychee are already in my head for what I 'll be trying next . The milk tea are n't the absolute best , but they 're no slouch either . I got a milk tea with boba ( + $ 0.60 ) and a jasmine milk tea . Both tea tasted like the real tea with the typical milk tea creaminess and flavor . The boba is green honey boba , which I recall learning is a more natural color than the ubiquitous black-colored boba . It wa properly cooked to a nice chewiness , not too soft or hard . Think Boba is a great addition to the boba scene and will be on my list for the fruit flavor and the late hour ( thus far ) . That 's actually quite serendipitous considering my desire not to have caffeine around midnight . I 'll also have to try the oolong tea and perhaps the matcha ice cream milk tea during earlier hour . Oh , and if anything doe n't pan out for some reason , I 'll definitely take up the owner 's policy to remake the drink . \n",

      "Definitely wa craving a boba fix especially since i do n't have it readily available anymore ! this place did the trick ! I got the jasmine milk team with boba and my friend got an almond slush with boba ! Super happy with both . the boba itself wa super soft and exactly what you 'd want from any type of tapioca pearl . It wa almost a good a tea station , or i might just be having a memory lapse since i have n't had any boba in so long . but the almond slush wa just a amaazing . super almond flavor and i 'm pretty sure they do n't use powder which is why the jasmine milk tea wa ridiculously creamy and flavorful with the entire taste of jasmine . I will definitely be back here to get my fix ! \n",

It is just the right amount of sweetness , but can be adjusted is desired , and ha some unique , tasty flavor . The regular size is quite big so it should be more than satisfying for most . They do the stamp card and can use it for some of their cute toy prize or a milk tea after 10 stamp . The inside is small but cozy and comforting . They have board game you can use and the place is clean . This is a must try if you 're having a sweet tooth in or near Chinatown . \n",

      "Having moved from the super-boba-shop-saturated Socal , I am on a mission to find the best boba in Vegas . So I wa super excited to stumble across a 5 star tea house that had just opened up . YAY Thanks Yelp for always introducing me to new place . Tea of Joy is located right next to Magal ( which is probably my favorite Vegas KBBQ place , but I digress ) . Since there are essentially only two food place in this plaza , parking is super easy to find . There is a huge patio leading up to the entrance , which I imagine will eventually be filled up with cute table . The decor is very simple and clean ; they have a wood theme going on , which I think is very photo friendly and cute . In addition to the usual tables/chairs , they also have a hangout corner where you can play on their PS4 . They also had a bookshelf with Scrabble and Sorry -- I imagine they will be filling those shelf with more game in the future . They have a huge huge menu . Their special drink had innovative name but did n't help much in figuring out what the drink were made of -- so it wa really nice of the worker to walk u through the menu . I asked which drink they recommended/what their favorite were . I got their green thai milk tea with boba , and my friend got their jasmine milk tea . They were not selling the item on their `` snack menu '' just yet . I talked to the worker , and apparently they just had their grand opening yesterday ( 2/1/17 ) . CAN I JUST REITERATE ABOUT HOW WELCOMING THE WORKERS MADE ME FEEL ? Unfortunately , they do n't accept credit card yet ... I hope they do it soon because I hardly ever carry cash with me ( which ... I should start doing ) . They are currently doing a promotion where if you write a review on yelp/fb , you get a free milk tea . That is how stupid me got to try their drink today . So if anybody actually get to this paragraph of my review , I would take all the 5 star review with a grain of salt . ( LOL , I know I write stupidly long review . ) Additionally , while my friend and I were still hanging out there with our tea , they offered u some complimentary macarons . So let 's get on with reviewing their product : **I did not pay for the drinks/macarons , but the price off the menu are pretty steep.We did tip them with what little cash we did have , though . ** Their drink definitely are very strong in tea flavor . I appreciate that . I actually really liked my friend 's jasmine milk tea . The green thai milk tea left me a little confused ; even now , I 'm not really sure how to describe the taste . But for sure , it 's nothing like the thai tea we 're normally used to . Instead , the green thai milk tea is super duper duper heavy on the tea flavor The boba wa chewy and soft , but I wish it would have more flavor to it -- the boba did n't actually taste like anything . The macarons we had were fruity pebble and cocoa pebble . My friend and I both agreed that the filling wa good . We did not really like the macaron cookie itself ; I felt like the almond flour wa not sifted properly -- so the cookie texture wa grainy . TL ; DR This place ha a lot of potential . It is pretty pricey . They have a huge selection ( and I am actually really excited for their snack menu ) . Their customer service is SO.ON.POINT . Once they get that credit card machine running/start selling snack , I can imagine this could be a popular hang out spot . 3 star for the food +1 star for the amazing service . I would come back just for the service . \n",

      "Decided to try this place since we were in the area and wa wanting some boba a an afternoon snack but wa sorely disappointed here with all those high rating and review ! Maybe it wa a bad day for them but the boba wa way over cooked , it wa mush and the drink were watered down . We ordered a jasmine milk tea and it wa watered down with the mushy boba . Then we got the red bean milk tea with boba and lychee.. that tasted more like lychee milk tea with bit of red bean in it . I mean there are good thing here too like the place wa clean and price are great ! The fried tofu wa okay , it nothing to write home about but it good . The sauce it came with wa the best part ! Haha we may give this place a second chance but we still like JT boba house so far in avondale ! *edit lowered to ONE star cuz the person who work there must think theyre so cool cuz they pulled right into the handicapped spot right in front and he looked like he wa maybe in his 20 ... with his gf or something walking out like it no big deal ! Hate people who dont have any care or respect for marked handicapped spot . Will not be coming back ! \n",

      "This place had great review so we decided to try it out for a boba tea . I think we were expecting a little better . The boba flavor were kind of limited , but we were glad to see they do half sweetness since the sample of the full sweetness tea wa like drinking pure sugar . This place is definitely traditional and wa selling a lot of traditional dessert , especially with a lot of red bean item . We got the jasmine milk tea and winter melon . They put a lot of bobas in the tea a well , almost too many . The bobas were slightly dry on the inside and not a good a some other honey bobas I 've had . I do n't think I 'd go here again but it wa n't bad . \n",

      "Meh . My family came with my vegan friend last Saturday and we were really let down . They typically stock only 3 vegan flavor , and 1 of them wa out ... All they had wa vegan vanilla & vegan peanut butter cookie . I wa REALLY REALLY craving the peanut butter chocolate chip vegan shake I had at the other location . So , then we move on to the regular flavor . They were out of cooky & cream and only had `` asian '' flavor '' + vanilla & cookie dough . My husband & I were sharing since the shake are so large , but we could n't agree on a flavor because he doe n't like `` asian '' flavor . He turned me down when I suggested lychee , black sesame , and red bean . Durian wa certainly out of the question , and green tea wa out of stock ... We ended up settling on a milk tea & a jasmine green tea milk tea with almond milk for me . Since I wa with my vegan friend , I asked to see if the jasmine milk tea would be vegan , since I suggest almond milk , but when he showed u the bag , it had some weird milk protein that she could n't have in the green tea . Bummer . The guy wa very nice , although the girl working seemed SO clueless on how to make anything . She had to ask him everything , like `` do we have this flavor '' when she could have walked over and checked ... He said because they just opened , they will be getting in more flavor soon and knew that they were limited . I 'd say not very kid friendly a they only have high bar stool & 2 table with high bar stool ( 1 which had employee stuff strewn about ) ... . Overall , I have 1 more groupon left to spend at this place . I will come back in a couple of week . Hopefully they will have received more flavor by then . \n",

      "My friend drove me here one time and I did n't wan na step in after seeing the line outside . BUT NOW I know why . I 'm seriously here everyday or every other day now . My boyfriend and I are suuuuper inlove with the drink here . Especially the oolong milk tea . The first thing I had ever ordered wa a white gourd milk tea , with grass jelly -- bc I do not like the tapioca boba thing . Their grass jelly is soooooo good . I could seriously eat it with just milk , lol . Then I tried some drink off of my friend which were super delicious too . Mango snow ( milk ) , because I do n't like fruity thing , this mango milk slush wa gr8 with the mango jelly ! My little sister got a peach oolong tea ( first time I ever had oolong ) , it took a couple sip to get used to.. But now I 'm inlove with this tea . Like I said , I 'm probably here every other day now . Even though it 's quite a drive from my house , it is so worth it ! Now I usually just always get white gourd milk tea with grass jelly . And my boyfriend get the oolong oreo milk tea , with boba . All the time . I tried the coffee flavor too , which were BOMB ... But I do n't wan na waste coffee flavor at a delicious TEA spot , you know . I also tried the strawberry milk slush , which I will never get LOL . Other than that . I love this place . I just have a rlly strong passion n luv for this place Srsly Best drink place in Vegas . YESSSzz . \n",

      "I think this is the first time I ever gave a one-star review to an overly-hyped boba shop . But this is also the first time I ever gave up on finishing an order of milk tea . Normally , I can drink a boba milk tea within 10 minute of receiving it . The oreo oolong milk tea that I got from Kung Fu Tea , however , sat around from 3pm to around 3am before I finally convinced my friend to finish it after becoming dehydrated from a night of partying . She did n't even like it when she first tried it with me and only gave in after not having anything else around to quench her thirst . That 's how disgusting it tasted . None of u boba lover wanted any of it . Furthermore , bogus charge . They had `` Oreo Oolong Milk Tea '' listed a one of their flavored milk tea option and so I assumed it wa the same listed price a all the other flavored milk tea drink , because , you know , that 's how every other boba shop doe it . But surprise ! I find out on my receipt that they charge you an extra 50 cent for some crumbles of an oreo cookie without telling you . So out of curiosity , I asked the cashier why I wa charged extra when I 've never been charged extra for the `` caramel '' in caramel milk tea or the `` taro '' in taro milk tea anywhere else . And she said that the `` free oreo button wa broken on the ipad . '' So I asked , `` Oh , so if I were to get Taro Milk Tea , the taro would 've been free and only oreo is n't free ? '' And she simply say yes . Strangely enough , Oreos are n't even an option from the additional topping list , so why do they have a `` 50 cent for oreo '' option but not a `` free oreo '' option when it 's not even a topping ? I honestly did n't even care about the 50 cent , I just think this is the dumbest excuse of a boba shop I 've ever heard . Do n't HIDE random bogus fee and then make up dumb reason ... Come on . \n",

      "I feel pretty lucky to know that a boba shop ha opened up so close to my house . Cloud Tea is a neat shop with plenty of seating and some interesting drink on the menu . I tried the Nagasaki milk tea with boba . The drink taste like a milky , creamy Chrysanthemum tea which is also shaken to death on those cool drink machine . My sister tried the Matcha milk tea and it taste a bit sweeter than I expected . Actually , the sweetness in both drink stuck to the roof of my mouth . On the other hand , the boba is good and taste pretty fresh . I came back again and tried the pistachio almond milk tea . Woah ! It definitely taste like what the name say . I thoroughly enjoyed it and I had a good time getting some studying done . \n",

      "I wa super excited to try this place ! Kind of a hidden location - they only have a banner sign , so we almost missed it . Great selection of drink though . I got the pistachio almond milk tea , and it wa perfect ! Unfortunately my friend 's Nagasaki wa a bit too sweet . You can pick sweetness level when you order , so maybe we will get it one level lower next time . There were plenty of table and chair , and they even had some board game . The only thing about this place wa that their music were way too quiet , which made the entire place too quiet . Maybe because we were the only customer there at the time , but we honestly felt like we had to whisper to each other when we were talking . I guess it 's better than them blasting out their music , but it still felt pretty awkward lol maybe raise the volume just a bit ? And you definitely will feel the stare behind the register . Other than that , this place is definitely worth checking out for . \n",

      "Probably the best boba I 've ever had . A friend had really hyped this place up before we made a trip out to Vegas . So I knew it had to be good because she rarely give out that glowing of a review . Almond milk tea is my favorite so of course I ordered it with the honey boba . At most boba place I 've tried it taste strongly of almond extract , but here it taste like ACTUAL almond . The boba wa fresh and they give you a generous amount of it . It wa so good we went back the next morning ! The second time I got the pistachio milk tea . I had never seen it before ( at least in California ) , and I like it more than almond milk tea now . I got the pistachio with crystal boba . And although I enjoyed it , honey boba is what I prefer . Definitely will be going back when I 'm in Vegas again . \n",

      "Whyyyyyyy whhyyyy fat dumpling ? Why you got ta do me dirty like that ? ! We could have had something special . My boyfriend and I are hard core boba head and we just needed our fix tonight . Being that it 's our first time here , we even went a far a buying 3 drink total between the 2 of u . You really let u down ! Weak flavor , mushy boba , whack customer service - all terrible . Here 's the story : I ordered the lemon honey green tea with half boba . Man , I did n't expect it to come out with the whole lemon , seed , bitter rind , pulp and all . The wide boba straw slurped up all of the seed every time I would take a sip . I choked on a few . Then I decided I could n't go through with it , it just did n't taste right , and brought the drink back to the counter . The guy wa not having it . He told u that the drink is not for u to taste , but for u to buy ... Whaaa ? Wait huh ? Accent or no accent , those are some fighting word mister . He then said he would pick out the seed for u . Ugh . No , the drink taste weird mister . It 's not good . At all . He said he would not exchange the drink out for something else . We had to stand at the counter for a while and firmly tell him that we would like to have the almond milk tea instead , that the the lemon seed were horrible . After a few minute of going back and forth he then tried to exchange it out for a small almond milk tea with no boba . Lol . This guy is a character . So stingy ! In the end he gave in and we got the almond milk tea with boba - woohoo an even ( embarrassing ) exchange . To my dismay , the drink tasted like a lot of hatred went into it . My almond milk tea tasted like pure powdered thick milk . That 's the flavor I got . Why you got ta hate to hard ? Not to mention the other 2 drink we got : durian slush and red bean slush - were super watery ! Icy slushy ice is what we ended up getting . To be fair : they were clean inside , had a huge menu ( they even have a vietnamese menu ! ) the drink were cheap , not a sugar bomb , and they are open late ! Sorry fat dumpling . Your antic are too much for me to handle . I do n't want to hate a hater , but you 's terrible ! \n",

      "This place suck . We were looking for a quick place to grab some boba and popcorn chicken and this happens to be the closest one so we made a stop . We have a Tea Station back home so we were kinda expecting a good experience . This place ha ample seating , which wa nice . I like how detailed their menu is but this is where all the good stuff stop . Our party of 5 ordered popcorn chicken and different kind of drink . When our drink came , we were quite disappointed . I had the passion fruit green tea w/ aloe vera and I tasted no passion fruit . It tasted very bland and watered down . They gave a lot of aloe vera which is great , I guess , but I would prefer to have my tea taste more flavorful ! I tried one of my friend 's drink which wa an almond milk tea and that also tasted like water w/ just a hint of flavor . It wa n't milky or sweet like what an almond milk tea should taste like . Our order of popcorn chicken came out with no sweet & sour sauce . I 've been to so many different place before and is n't it just normal that popcorn chicken should come with sweet & sour sauce without u having to ask ? Tell me I 'm not expecting too much here . But it 's okay , we asked for some . Although we had 2 order of the popcorn chicken among 5 people , the girl brought out one small dipping sauce expected to be shared . Ugh , skimpy much ? Anyways , pas ! \n",

      "After two year of being deprived of so many delightful food and drink , I have come back full force . Although , I am beginning to think that I could easily live without these indulgence that add onto my ever growing waistline . Boba is one of those drink that you get every time you pas by Chinatown . It is one of those quintessential stop that make for a good Asian experience . There is a large influx of boba place sprouting up all around town so you can get it anytime and anywhere . The service is a bit slow , but the girl wa polite and made it a point to address u while she wa preparing a large order . My criticism is aimed towards the drink recipe . I ordered the mango green tea with lychee jelly and my friend ordered the almond milk tea with boba . The mango wa sickeningly sweet and way too orange to be natural . I like Volcano better because it ha the tint of real tea . The almond milk tea tasted like I wa drinking marzipan . These drink were ridiculously sweet . I am starting to get this tingling on the side of my tongue . Should I be afraid ? Diabetes is not something I want to get diagnosed with in the future , so I will not be going back . \n",

      "Jozo doe n't have a sign up yet , so if you 're planning on coming here ( which I would suggest you do n't ) look for the small white lettering on the door . I also suggest they do n't put a sign up , because I 'm not sure how long the shop will last . With so many boba shop moving out of Spring Mountain and into the rest of Vegas , it wa about time a boba shop made an appearance in Henderson . However , maybe this unfilled niche need to stay unfilled . We ordered the Classic Taiwanese milk tea , almond milk tea and taro smoothie . The milk tea tasted like sugar water , with no hint of milk tea whatsoever . The almond milk tea wa better because it did n't taste like only sugar water , but instead sugar water with a hint of almond . Unlike any taro drink I 've had , the taro smoothie wa not sweet at all and wa colorless . When we asked why it did n't look like the purple drink they had posted picture of , they offered to add food coloring to the drink ... ... ... ... .. GHOST BOBA ? ! What kind of bastardization of boba is that ? ! The sugar in boba is supposed to make it black ... . So doe the boba here not have sugar in it ? Because I would n't be surprised . Have you ever tasted something that had more texture than taste ? Well that 's what the boba here tasted , or felt like ? It had such a hard texture , and it CRUMBLED in my mouth . It wa n't chewy and there wa absolutely no taste . Make like a ghost and disappear you `` ghost boba , '' you were so , so bad . Oh , also the boba so almost too big for the straw they had hahaha . It wa a struggle to get those thing through the straw at first , but after tasting them , I wa glad it kept them out . With the shop being near so many college it would have been better to make it more study friendly . The table were communal style with hard chair and there were n't very many accessible outlet . They had a few comfy couch , but with only 2 area it wa filled with people the entire time we were there . Do n't come here expecting to find a seat ! I would suggest coming here for a quick chat rather than expecting to be able to study for hour . The kitchen is in the back , so no sound of loud coffee blender . Which I really , really appreciated ! And yes , you get to keep the glass jar your drink come in . But for $ 5.00+ for a regular size drink ? Not worth it . Will it be cheaper if I bring my own cup ... .. not that I 'll be back ... .. \n",

      "I wa n't impressed . I wa in town and wanted some boba . I looked on Yelp and found this place based on the review and check in offer . We got an almond milk tea and the famous taro milk with boba . Both were bland . It tasted like it had a lot of that powdered creamer I noticed a lot of boba place in Vegas use but not enough actual flavor . The best way to describe it 's a if it 's missing a half a scoop of powder . They could have added an extra scoop of taro and almond and it would have tasted like it should have , instead of tasting like creamer and ice . The boba wa pretty bland a well . No hint of honey or sugar or anything that 's usually cooked with boba . The person taking the order wa nice and efficient , especially since he wa both taking order and making drink . We were in and out quickly but that doe n't make up for bland drink . Next ! \n",

      "I 've been going to Chewy 's since it first opened , and I used to think this place wa decent . A solid 3.5 . It wa n't always the best , but it 's conveniently located across from UNLV , and it did a good enough job of satisfying your boba craving . The last few time I 've been here , though , I 've noticed a steady downgrade in quality . There wa a lot of hit and miss item on the menu beforehand , and the drink were obviously made with powder . But now , even favorite that I have always ordered did n't taste very good . The almond milk tea and Hokkaido I ordered on my last three visit tasted like straight up water , and the boba wa ( gasp ! ) not chewy , but tough and hard and disappointing . All those visit were at night , so maybe it 's just the night shift that 's slacking ? Or the boba ha been sitting too long ? And on my last visit , I used a stamp card , so maybe I should n't complain because it wa free . I guess I just expected there would be better quality control and the loyalty card , would uh , reward you for your loyalty with something that doe n't taste like water . Overall , I probably wo n't be back anytime soon . Considering the disappointing experience , I 'm in no rush to try and fill out another stamp card . Plus one star for the cute decor , but minus three for the terrible boba . \n",

The girl who took my order wa food prep glove however kept them on when handling my money , then continued wearing the same pair returning to the prep area .

So I get the jasmine milk tea and it 's completely watered down , taste like plain watered down MILK My friend tried hers then mine and she confirmed that they tasted completely different . They either hated me and fucked up on purpose or they have no idea how to keep a consistent recipe but either way it 's a horrible way to run a business . This is my third time getting dragged here so this review is not just based on this visit . I always give place 3 time to redeem themselves . Kung fu tea is a huge disappointment .

      "I ca n't even begin to describe the TERRIBLE customer service here ! ! It wa my first time there and I asked the lady behind the counter what wa in the coconut milk tea and coconut milk ( yes.. in hindsight it seems obvious..but I wanted her to tell me what each drink looked/tasted like ) She gave me a dirty look and said `` coconut '' while tapping her pen impatiently . **Uh-huh** yes , I got that much from reading your menu that both drink have coconut.. but is there anything else you can add to that description to help me decide ? Is one sweeter/thicker/blended/over ice..etc than the other ? So I raised an eyebrow at her response , but ordered the coconut milk tea and laughed it off a a typical asian place with hasty service . THEN when my drink came , I took one sip and it literally tasted like Almond syrup sludge . So I said.. `` Um this is almond milk tea , I ordered coconut . '' First she say `` no I wrote down here almond '' and I stare at her and said `` I asked you about the coconut drink then ordered it , remember ? . '' OH..this woman had the nerve to ask `` OK , SO ? '' SOoOoO ? ! Are you insane ? How can you run a business being this rude even for Chinatown ? I gave her my best death stare and told her to give me what I ordered . It got to the point where another customer who she wa chatting it up with wa apologizing profusely for her attitude . ( Later I found out that he wa an owner at the noodle shop nearby ) . She finally shouted something into the kitchen staff and they handed over a new drink ... which still tasted like syrup sludge ... now in coconut flavor . Bottom line : gross sludge drink + rude service.. Go somewhere else for your boba ! \n",

      "I love matcha . So when I passed by this place after an OTF workout , I knew I had to drop in when it opened . Well it finally opened and they offered 20 % off the order for grand opening weekend . Score ! But the price are n't bad to begin with . This place ha such a cute atmosphere and lot of table for seating . Everything blend in so pretty- the color , the furniture , the lighting . I can go on . I feel like atmosphere is important . The owner explained that the matcha is straight from Japan and that their drink are n't too sweet to begin with . And that is true because with 25 % sweetness level , I found it perfect since I 'm not a sweet fan of drink . All the worker are knowledgeable about the drink and friendly . Imperial Matcha- 5 star for this drink itself . I love matcha and I love it straight and simple . Simple , pure , refreshing . Definitely have that matcha taste . You have the option of making this a latte . Absolutely delicious and way better than Starbucks . *when you add any mousse : try the mousse first , then the tea , then mix* Peach Oolong ( add tiramisu mousse ) - I highly recommend the tiramisu mousse . So creamy and not too sweet . A perfect mix into the peach Oolong tea since Oolong can be a bit bitter itself . The peach Oolong tea really pull through . You can taste the peach . Yummmm ! White grape Oolong ( add cheese mousse ) - cheese must be the new thing with drink , but how can such a mix be good ! ? It is with this white grape oolong tea . Kind of reminds me white wine and cheese pairing . My fave too ! ! This drink wa recommended by the owner . They do also have milk tea if you are a fan of those instead of plain tea . Oh and dessert . I have yet to try ... . but I 'll be coming back to get those if I wa n't kind of watching my sweet intake . 5 star because I 'm a matcha fanatic , but also because this place doe have amazing drink and great vibe too . \n",

      "With the popularity of Matcha-centered cafe popping up next door in California , it 's refreshing to have a bit of that trend here in the Henderson/Vegas area . I believe it 's the only cafe that is focused on matcha and bringing a quality matcha drink to the community . Upon first arriving , it 's like a mini Ikea showroom with the typically Ikea piece ( table , chair , bookshelf ) . The space itself is a little big and feel spaced out . It look like a great place to hunker down and study for a while . Either way , we 're not here for the space itself , we 're here for our matcha fix . We got the imperial grade iced matcha with a tiramisu mousse & regular sweetness . You have the choice between cheese , tiramisu , or avocado mousse . The tiramisu mousse lends the matcha a sweet , chocolate flavor . It really make the entire drink a lot more rich and creamy . I would recommend this for your first time here since it 's a solid , safe choice . The only downside wa the price point . It 's pricey for what you get . I believe we paid around $ 8-9 for one regular sized drink . It 's a good place if you 're really craving matcha , but it would n't be my regular go-to cafe due to the price . I have n't tried all the other drink just yet , and I 'll update my review once I have . I 'm excited to return here to see what else they have to offer . \n",

      "All boba shop kinda taste the same after awhile , so when I heard there wa a new matcha place in town that served cheese mousse I had to check it out . I wa pleasantly surprised because this place automatically became my favorite spot for drink . My favorite is the white oolong tea with cheese mousse , regular sweetness . The cheese mousse is served a a topping on top of the tea and is meant to stay a separate distinct layer . It taste salty and is garnished with speck of matcha powder . It is recommended that you drink a little of the cheese mousse and a little of the tea with each gulp , so that you experience both layer . Some people like to mix the two layer so that no effort is required when drinking . I personally like drinking the layer separately . The oolong tea ha hint of white grape , which is unique and unlike many popular drink served here in Las Vegas . The imperial matcha with tiramisu mousse wa another popular drink recommended by yelpers . It is the finest grade matcha that wa offered and it certainly did not disappoint . The consistency of this drink wa much more think and creamy , almost like a watered down milkshake . I liked this drink with the layer mixed together rather than separate . Board game are offered here along with ample seating . I usually end up finishing my drink during a game of chess , so I must always debate if I want to order another one for the road . They 're located in Henderson right next to Purple Potato , which is a 15-20 min drive from where I live . They 're worth the drive since they 're THAT GOOD ! I hope they get popular soon and open up a second location in the Southwest ! \n",

      "This place is booomb . The grade of matcha they use is amazing ! I always get the imperial matcha which is the highest . The price are definitely high for a drink but I think it is worth it . I 've tried the cheese mousse and the tiramisu mousse with the imperial matcha and I liked them both ! I ca n't really say if I like one more than the other because it depends on what mood I 'm in haha . The cheese one is cheesy and it doe n't really taste like sea salt cream ( just an fyi ) and the tiramisu is on the sweeter side . I 've also had the white grape oolong with cheese mousse and that wa really good ! It 's very sweet so I recommend taking the sweetness down a little . Next time I come in I wan na try their hot matcha . They have a black sesame one for the holiday so I 'll be back before it 's gone ! \n",

      "My kid love matcha anything so you can just imagine how much his face lit up when I told him about this place opening up . He could n't wait to try to this place out and once we did , he wa in heaven . We 've tried a couple drink , but of course the first one we had to try were their matcha tea . On our first visit , he decided to go with the fuji matcha milk tea with boba . He can definitely taste the quality of the matcha and had no complaint and wa perfectly happy with it . This is definitely not your Starbucks iced green tea latte ; ) But what totally got his attention wa when my drink came out - the Imperial matcha green tea with tiramisu mousse . Right off the bat , he wa like `` mommy what is that , why did n't I get that ? '' LOL The taste in the imperial is definitely much stronger than the fuji , in my opinion . If you enjoy the taste of high quality matcha , get the imperial and top if off with the tiramisu mousse for that extra sweet kick . The flavor of the two go together hand in hand . This drink is definitely a winner in my family circle . Not only doe my son and I love this drink , but so doe the husband , my other boy , and sister ! Now they do offer other drink besides matcha , for day you are not in the mood for it . My favorite non-matcha drink so far is the white grape oolong tea with cheese mousse . YES , cheese mousse ! Who would have thought to add cheese mousse to your drink . Well whoever thought , `` hey let 's make cheese mouse and add it a a topping for our tea '' is a genius ! The cheese mousse add a different level to the drink . It give it that nice salty flavor then mixed with the sweetness of the tea , perfection = ) The shop itself is pretty spacious and clean . I love how the decor is very bright and contemporary and finding parking is never an issue . However , it is a bit more on the pricier side than the other tea house in the area . But ca n't really complain since the quality is definitely there . \n",

( unfortunately they were out of boba ) This is some of the best matcha green tea I 've had in Vegas , there 's really nothing quite like it . ( I 've been to 100x place in Las Vegas area ) . The creaminess of the rich mousse go very well with the iced matcha tea . We sat comfortably on the gray couch and waited for our drink , the nice server kindly explained how to drink the mousse before mixing it into the iced matcha . It wa a refreshing experience and i will definitely be back ! p.s . They offer a loyalty program by entering your # ! : ) \n",

The staff is incredibly friendly , and are happy to answer any question you may have . Their menu is pretty short and sweet , which is great for a place like this . I always order the imperial matcha tea , which ha their highest grade matcha available . It 's nothing short of excellent . I 've tried the latte , tried it with boba , and tried it with their tiramisu mousse . All really delicious and high-quality . The price are a bit steep , but you definitely get what you pay for .

I decided to try the matcha latte and it wa very earthy . Like I said , not what I 'm used to . It wa n't bad but it wa n't amazing . After that drink , I did n't think I 'd be back . But I did come once more and got the peach black tea with the cheese mousse . I wa a bit hesitant about the cheese mousse ... `` cheese ? On tea ? I dunnnooo ... '' But hey , let 's try it . I 'm so happy I tried it because it 's probably the best topping ever invented ! The cup have a little lid that you just sip from and get that hint of cheese with your tea . Trust , it 's good !

I do n't care for the aforementioned at all , but wa told that Matcha House wa AMAZING by a trusted foodie companion . On my first venture ( with said companion ) I knew I wanted to go with a mousse . They have a salty , cheese , and tiramisu mousse . I did n't know which one to choose so they allowed me to try all three . While I am a cheese freak I did not not care for it ( I think I am the minority here so GO FOR IT lol ) , I went with tiramisu and paired it with their highest grade Imperial Matcha and chia topping ! We also ordered chocolate banana honey toast which wa perfect and delicious ! ! ! The matcha wa the best and refreshing drink which I dreamt about for day to come . I made up excuse to go to Henderson . I live on the opposite side of town ! I ca n't wait till Sunny ( sp ? ) is able to expand ! ! ! ! ! \n",

      "The tea scene is getting more diverse in the Las Vegas area , and I 'm glad that Henderson is reaping the benefit . Matcha House Tea and Sweets is the newest entrant into this rapidly expanding segment , and they 're on Eastern Avenue across from the St. Rose Siena Hospital . They just had their grand opening on September 9th , with 20 % off drink ( and free cupcake that were actually pretty delicious , but wo n't be offered regularly here ) . They have a small bubble tea type menu , a matcha series , some mocktails , and a food menu with a few savory item and a bunch of cake , honey toast , and some sort of shaved ice . I 've yet to have any of the food , but I figured that I should weigh in on the drink . But first , the so-called mousse topping ( $ 0.75 each ) are easily the star . These are cream that have recently been seen at other tea shop , and they are served a a layer on top of the drink which can be mixed in if desired . Some place even encourage you to sip the drink so that you can get the flavor of the topping and the drink , but the `` mousse '' here seems to be a little too thick . However , they do provide a lid that can be opened halfway to let you taste the mousse alone without removing the lid entirely . The cheese mousse is excellent . It actually doe taste like a mild cheese ( not a cream cheese ) and is n't necessarily a salt-forward flavor . The tiramisu mousse is also very fun , and it 's perhaps smoother and a little more easily dissolved into the drink than the cheese mousse . It definitely would pair better with a drink that is low in sweetness . The avocado mousse also ha the requisite flavor and aroma , with a small amount of salt to boot . I do like the drink somewhat . All the iced drink that I 've seen are served in a 24 oz cup . The Imperial matcha ( $ 6.75 regular price ) is their highest grade of matcha , and it 's strong in said matcha flavor . I thought it went nicely at 75 % ( `` le '' ) sweetness , but maybe I can handle 50 % or even lower . It did pair nicely with the cheese mousse , which mean I 'd likely order it again if only to complement the topping . ( By the way , a little birdy told me that the Fuji matcha here is too inferor in flavor and cost to justify the 50 cent saving , so I 'm probably never going to order it . ) The peach oolong iced tea ( $ 4.75 ) wa my second order . I also ordered it le sweet , but could 've gone for the 50 % level because it still tasted pretty sweet . The peach flavor wa pretty much the only thing I could discern , with nothing from the supposed oolong base jumping out . I did find out that I can order le ice , and I 'm considering ordering it with no ice in the future . Tiramisu mousse wa fine here , but a I implied , it sweetness did n't stand out . My latest sip wa the Ceylon iced tea ( $ 4.75 ) , which wa my vehicle for the avocado mousse . The Ceylon is a pretty typical black tea , and it actually carry the avocado very well when you mix the mousse thoroughly into the tea . Having an avocado drink without the heaviness of a smoothie is such a treat . The flavor wa just right at 50 % sweetness , and there wa n't any underfill when I requested to have it with no ice . Rewards for frequent customer are offered via the FiveStars program , which is linked to your phone number and a mobile app . I used a 10 % off discount on that peach oolong , and hopefully they 'll send out more offer from time to time . Come to Matcha House for the mousse topping . Until they start showing up elsewhere , this is the best local place for that particular goodness . The tea are quite good too , although the variety is lower than at competitor . I 'll have to find a good time to try the dessert here , but they 're a little pricey and/or large in portion so I 'm not convinced that I 'd regularly order 'em . \n",

      "My friend and I let the two gentleman that wa working behind the counter know it wa our first time here . They were super nice and explained all the different kind of matcha tea , the customization of the level of sweetness you want in your drink , and he even let u sample a few of the mousse . We tried their signature cheese mousse and the tiramisu . Personally , the thought of cheese mousse in my matcha drink just doe n't sound right to me . I 'm sure it taste bomb af but we opted for the tiramisu . ( I might be brave enough next time and choose the cheese mousse option . ) So we ordered the Uji Imperial Matcha with tiramisu mousse and the Peach Matcha . We really enjoyed both drink . I 'm sure it 's obvious but adding the mousse option make the drink so smooth and creamy while the iced peach matcha wa very refreshing . Perfect for a hot summer day . So different drink for different mood . We also ordered the matcha cheesecake and a side of popcorn chicken . OHHHH MAN ... .just those two item alone is enough for me to make a return visit .

      "It wa my first time here today and it wa very good ! I came here to study with friend and the table are super spacious and there are lot of table . The music is not too loud so it 's a great study spot or socializing spot . How the ordering work : First ; you choose the type of tea you want , so I got the Fuji matcha which is strong of the matcha taste but is not strong to the point where the drink is bitter . Second ; You choose whether you want mousse on top of the drink or if you want it into a latte or both . I decided to get the tiramisu mousse and if I were to describe it , I would say it 's like a sea salt cream that you 'd get on a latte with a hint of tiramisu flavor . The flavor of the mousse doe not overpower the matcha drink which I appreciate . And with the mousse it make the drink a little le creamy than a usual milk tea latte . Lastly ; you choose topping and they have chia seed , grass jelly , aloe vera , and of course boba . I got boba and the only downside to that wa that the boba wa a little softer than I would 've liked . The price here are a bit pricey , just for one drink I paid $ 8 . But I do find myself coming back here more often . P.S Sunny is AMAZING ! ! ! She gave my friend and I a free cupcake \n",

      "I live across town and I wa talking to a friend about matcha tea and I had to look for a place that doe just matcha tea and I came across this place ! ! ! Finally drove here and I will have to say I found my favorite matcha place . I tried the imperial matcha tea latte with almond milk and tiramisu mousse on top . And never would of thought how good that wa . If you love matcha tea you must try this place . I also got the chocolate banana honey bread and it 's quite filling which make sense why she said it can feed up to two people . I recommend this place for sure . Now I just need one on my side of town \n",

      "Great place ! I have been here twice and tried the Imperial Matcha with tiramisu mousse and the Imperial Matcha latte with cheese mousse topping . Both tasted great , smooth tasting , can definitely taste the matcha without it being overwhelming which can sometimes happen . The price is a little pricey , almost $ 6 for a drink plus a little more if you have any add-on but you do get a large drink ( only one size ) . The staff wa very friendly , especially the one who wa patient with me when I had some question . They also serve the drink to you while you 're waiting rather than just calling your name which wa a nice touch . And if you stay to enjoy your drink , they do come up to you and ask how it is . The place wa pretty big , with table on one side and couch on the other . It wa bright and I loved the cute tea saying that decorated the place . The inside wa very instagram worthy and seemed like a nice place to hang out with friend ( there were even some board game at the front that you could bring to your table and play ) . Overall , this wa a great place for green tea and green tea inspired dessert and I would definitely come back and recommend others to come here ! ! \n",

      "This place is amazing ! I came here with my boyfriend and his cousin and I probably would n't have found it without them . I would have never come here only because I do n't like matcha , but this place ha changed my opinion on it . I 'm all for matcha now ! ! The owner recommended that we get the Imperial Matcha because it is the highest grade that they have . We ordered the Imperial Matcha with tiramisu mousse on top , regular sweetness annnnnddddddd oh my goodness ! I have never tasted anything like it . The matcha and the tiramisu just go so well together . It is a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for in my opinion . Overall , Matcha House Tea and Sweets is a chill place to hang out at and study . They have board game , drink , and snack . And to top it all off , the staff are all so nice and check up on you if you need anything else . \n",

I usually get the Imperial matcha with tiramisu mousse 50 % sweet extra mousse . It really is so good and so refreshing . Usually I take my time drinking drink but when I get this I literally devour it in minute , so good ! I do want to try all the other stuff on the menu like the tea and dessert .

      "I highly recommend their roasted buckwheat matcha w/ the tiramisu mousse ! Order it 50 % sweet if you want more matcha tea flavor . It taste similar to the genmaicha at Brew ( I get the milk tea version there ) , genmaicha is known a brown rice green tea . I have also tried the imperial matcha here but to be honest it 's nothing special , tasted same a other matcha tea around town . Which is surprising because it the most expensive drink on the menu . Their roasted buckwheat matcha is worth trying/ordering for sure . I also have enjoyed their honey toast with red bean & matcha ice cream here but I wished that they also had more dessert option . Hopefully in future they 'll have stuff like matcha soft serve . This spot is a decent place for getting some studying done . \n",

Something about green tea and strawberry is so refreshing and satisfying ! I 've also tried their matcha with the tiramisu mousse , and it created this sort of caramel taste . Bombdiggity . Their popcorn chicken is pretty good a well . I just wish they could make it spicy . I 'm thirstin for another matcha drink a I type this . \n",

      "The drink were really plain . Was really looking forward to trying out the cold drink but it wa a let down since the matcha did n't seem to be blended with the milk in the bubble tea it tasted really powdery ...

      "It definitely wa not zero degree , or even a reasonably comfortable temperature , inside Zero Degrees when we went . The place wa packed full of people due to it being the Grand Opening , but there 's a problem when it is cooler outside in the shade on an Arizona afternoon in May than in the shop . The line wa long and we almost left because it wa n't moving very fast but decided we could tough it out for the BOGO deal . While waiting we were asked to check-in on the Yelp app . ( Probably to help speed thing up , but also to get the free publicity ... hmmm ... ? ) When I paid we did n't receive the BOGO offer . What give ? We ordered off the flyer of select drink that were part of the deal . Turns out split cup and travel bottle do not count . Would have been swell to have an employee point that out . We would have just ordered both drink full size instead of getting the split cup especially since that wa the main reason anyone would waiting in line for so long . As for the drink , I wa surprised that I really enjoyed the Strawberry Horchata much more than the Matcha Milk Tea , which is my usual go-to drink . I know matcha can lean a bit towards the bitter side but I did not enjoy the bitterness of this one . The ice used in the drink wa pretty good which is something that can be taken for granted but really can effect your overall enjoyment of a beverage . Also , the use of fresh fruit slice and fresh mint in the drink is a big plus for me ! This could have been a higher star review but there simply were too many fixable issue ( the heat inside the shop , long wait time , the BOGO confusion between employee and customer , bitter matcha ) that should have been handled better and sooner . Yeah , it is Grand Opening and it will be busy . However , is n't that the point of having a soft opening so your Grand Opening actually go well and making customer want to come back ? Would I return in the future ? Maybe . Am I disappointed from this first experience ? You betchya ! Doubt I 'll be back soon . \n",

      "Extremely disappointed . Came at around 1pm , no ice cream available even though they open at 12pm . Told u had to wait 30 minute . Friend and I ordered red bean latte and black sesame latte . Red bean wa alright , a bit on the sweet side ; black sesame on the other hand had no flavour , just tasted like hot milk . We also ordered a hokkaido matcha cookie `` lava '' cake and a roll cake . Both are total disappointment . Their `` lava '' cake is known in Japan a a Hokkaido chiffon cupcake . Lava cake , by patisserie definition , is BAKED to order . Very misleading . The cream itself wa very green , yet very bland . At least it wa a bit more edible than the roll cake . The sponge for the roll cake wa way too dense , not soft and airy like a sponge should be . The filling wa very generic , red bean mixed with whipped cream . Feeling when I ate the first and final bite : if I wanted to eat play-doh for $ 5 , I would have went to toy ' r'us instead . Took the remaining home to `` share '' with friend ... Even 7 of u could n't finish this slice of cake . If I could give no star I would , but I give them an `` A '' for effort ; at least the bag they gave me to take home the cake wa more decent to look at than the cake . \n",

      "Review 777 on St. Paddy 's ... lucky review for me ? Hope so ! What 's this ? Trendy Asian dessert in the middle of Streetsville ? Wow I would have never expected to have this in the middle of a run down strip mall . This maybe the first Japanese cheesecake spot I 've seen outside of a mall in GTA west . The spot is take out only a there are no table or even a bar stool . It 's quite sparse but there is an adorable cute cartoon of an astronaut rabbit and his adventure . The moon crater in the drawing are almost a big a the pot hole in the parking lot . My visit here on a Friday afternoon wa quiet at first with a single person behind the counter . Within a few moment , a line of 4 people just sprouted . Because there wa only one person , the 4 people just waited and waited . Do n't get me wrong , it wa a nice staff person but it 's still frustrating to wait and have no service . So there are 2 main offering ... the Japanese cheesecake and the cheese tart . The Japanese cheesecake is very different . It 's supposed to be a fluffy cotton soft texture that melt in your mouth . I 'm not sure how it is here a they do n't offer single slice . They also have bubble tea and hot drink but I think their main item are the cake and tart . The cheesecake come in several flavour : sweet cheese original , chocolate , red velvet , and their monthly flavour mocha . If you want the fluffy Japanese cheesecake , bring friend cause they only sell the one full cake for $ 12 . No slice sadly . The tart are small and $ 3 each . Original cheese tart - I appreciated how they were just cooking a fresh batch and we got ours just out of the oven . Since they do n't sell slice of the cheesecake , we got cheese tart instead . They are shortbread crumbly crust wa minimal flavour and filled to the brim with a creamy dense liquid cheese filling . It 's almost like a molten traditional cheesecake . The flavour is unmistakably sweet Philadelphia cream cheese . Though the creamy texture is quite nice , I 'm not sure if there is anything great that make me go `` ohhh I need more '' . Still a fairly nice tart 3.5/5 Strawberry bubble tea - huh ... for $ 6 this wa smaller than the small bubble tea of most other place . I think Chatime would be only $ 4 . This drink wa sadly watered down . I felt it wa not balanced with the amount of ice in it . Overall too small , too expensive , and no real flavour - 2/5 Matcha bubble tea - this wa slightly better than the strawberry but not really . It wa n't watery a much but still lacking good flavour that I would expect for $ 6 for a small cup . It wa missing a good matcha flavour . Not very good unfortunately 2.5/5 Overall , I like the look of the cute place but the lack of great flavour and higher cost make me think there 's better out there . \n",

      "NOT WORTH IT . SLOW SERVICE . LACKLUSTER & MISSING FOOD/DRINKS Visited : Saturday afternoon around 2:30PM for late lunch and sweet . First impression : Entered cafe and wa unsure a to if we should take a seat or order at the counter . No sign depicting what to do & only one laminated paper menu available on the counter . Decided to sit down and were greeted with menu ~ 5 minute later ( a couple that came in a few minute after u were greeted and had their order taken before u ) Ordered : 1 Mince pork rice , 2 pork belly rice , small thai milk tea w/honey boba , large orange yuzu tea w/honey boba ( orange yuzu is only available in the large size ) , matcha espresso latte , 1 honey toast , and 2 taiyaki . What we ACTUALLY got : 2 pork belly rice , small thai milk tea WITHOUT BOBA , large orange yuzu tea WITHOUT BOBA , matcha espresso latte , 1 honey toast , and ONLY ONE taiyaki . Entrees arrived before our drink . Saw other table that arrived AFTER u , receive their drink order before we did ( they ordered the same drink ! ) . My sister 's matcha espresso latte wa brought to u only after being left on another group 's table for a few minute . ( It did n't look like they drank out of it ... but at this point , we already were questioning a few thing ) . When I asked the server about the missing boba , he returned with another cup filled 1/4 way with boba and a small spoon . No boba straw wa provided ... boba through a regular straw is NOT what I had expected . Returned the boba to the front counter and let them know that I could n't enjoy it a it wa intended . Also noticed that I did not receive a small light to go under my orange yuzu ( all of the other table were provided with a light under their yuzu drink ) . Food availability : Cafe open at noon . Only 2.5 hour later they ran out of Mince Pork Rice . When the server wa asked about alternative , she noted that they also ran out of curry rice & that the skewer `` would take too long '' . Server did not offer any suggestion for what to order instead . Missing order : TAIYAKI : ( I had convinced my group to go to Cafe Summer after seeing the amazing picture on instagram and yelp of their taiyaki . Our table received 1 taiyaki ( strawberry ice cream with mochi/pocky stick , nutella filling ) and waited 25 minute ... .seeing that we had spent already over 2 hour at a cafe , I asked the server about my taiyaki order & she did not know how much longer it would be . At that point , I asked to cancel the order and pay off my bill -- which still had all of our other missing food order added into it . Service : Questionable . Servers were not very interactive or personable..when confronted with question about missing/incorrect order they would walk away before I could finish asking . Server also pushed u to order all of our food , drink , and desserts..noting that it would take longer if it wa done separately . Honestly , After waiting nearly 30 minute between each item , I do n't know how much slower it could 've been . OVERALL : Highly disappointed by my experience at Cafe Summer . For what food wa available , the food flavor wa lacking and left a lot to be desired . Service/poor execution of dish led u to have an unplanned 2+ hour lunch . I regret convincing my group to come here a I wa not able to try their signature TAIYAKI ( and from what we did receive of the other taiyaki , wa underwhelming and not well made ) . Lesson learned . \n",

      "I used to be okay spending more than 10 $ for two of their drink , but a lot ha changed apparently . My boyfriend tried getting almond milk for his earl grey tea with boba a a substitute for the regular milk , but the server looked him dead in the eye and said `` no . Ca n't do that . '' And so he tried getting the almond milk tea instead and the server said `` we ONLY have the flavor we do n't have almond milk ! '' So he settled for the earl grey tea . I decided to get the matcha green tea ice cream drink with boba like I usually do . Problem this time wa my boba wa not soft at all . The flavor wa also barely there . Why should I pay over 10 $ for horrible customer service AND horrible boba when I could spend a lot le and be greeted with patience and smile elsewhere . I 'm going to actively avoid ever going back here . \n",

      "I really wanted to like this place from the minute I saw it emerge from my usual trip to Chatime Midland . I 'm sad to say that I wa quite disappointed after my experience today . I visited Boba Boy on a quiet Wednesday night . I entered to find a small line with only 2 people in queue . Despite this , I waited about 8 minute in line . I ordered a winter melon milk tea and a matcha milk tea a well . After a short wait I got my first drink but I waiting maybe another 8 minute for my winter melon drink ! And even then , they got my order wrong , giving me regular tea instead only milk tea and leaving out the tapioca . After another short wait , I finally got my drink . When I got home and opened up my drink , I discovered that it wa just a plain milk tea ! They forgot the winter melon and messed my drink up once again . It wa too late to do anything now that I wa home so all I could do wa mumble to myself angrily a I drank this average bubble tea . The boba wa really good ; I guess that 's why they emphasize it in their name . However , the tea wa just average . Similar in taste to Presotea . I really did want to love Boba Boy . The place itself wa decent ( albeit the limited seating available ) , the menu option plentiful , and I liked the environmentally friendly idea of reusing their bottle ( though the straw were just a tad bit too short for the bottle ) . Overall , this self proclaimed bbtea connoisseur give Boba Boy a 2/5 , mostly for the sloppy service . \n",

      "Worst service and food I have ever had in my entire life ! ! ! I heard a lot of great thing about their Ontario location so I wa super excited to try Sugar Marmalade . We arrived on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm . The place wa quite busy but we only waited for about 5 minute to get a table . Once we were seated , one of the waitress handed u the menu right away . We ordered popcorn chicken , minced pork dish , a mango bubble tea , condensed milk toast and the matcha panna cotta . A minute later , one of the staff came over to u and mentioned that the condensed milk toast is sold out for the night . OKAY ? ! Uhm y'all just opened a couple of week ago , you do n't close until 10pm . How the hell are you running out of food already ? ! Anyways , moving on ... . the popcorn chicken and the minced pork dish arrived . Worst popcorn chicken I have ever had , some of the popcorn chicken they served me were not fully cooked ! ! ! The minced pork dish wa even worse , lack of flavour , dry , and it tasted old . So at this point , I wa just waiting for the bubble tea and the panna cotta , hoping it will change my perspective about this place , maybe they 're just having a bad day or they 're understaffed or whatever . So one of the lady came with a panna cotta that I did NOT order . She gave me black sesame instead of matcha and I told her it wa n't what I ordered and she tried to tell me that it wa what I ordered . UHM WTF at this point I just wanted to leave but I really wanted the dessert . So another lady came over and told me that the matcha panna cotta is sold out a well . AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH ! So I ended up ordering the mocha hazelnut pannacotta . She then told me that it is usually topped with vanilla ice cream but they did n't have any left either so I ended up getting green tea ice cream instead . The mango bubble tea wa nothing special , I 'd rather just go to chatime . The mocha hazelnut panna cotta wa terrible , i will choose to wait and line up outside of kazu in the middle of a snowstorm any day for their overpriced panna cotta . I wa tired , disappointed , annoyed , irritated and disgusted . I told one of the staff that the popcorn chicken wa uncooked and she said sorry and giggled and still charged u for the full price ! ! To conclude this rant , visiting this place wa a waste of time and money for u . The food wa more than terrible , it made me sick and the service wa unacceptable . I wish I can give this place negative star . \n",

      "I 've passed by this ( still somewhat ) newly opened tea shop a few time , but never bothered go in until now . It 's a storefront of the Cooksville Colonnade at the corner of Dundas and Hurontario . Parking is in the back of the complex if you 're coming in by car . The first thing I noticed when entering wa the decor and ambience wa on point . A spacious dining room with a traditional decor involving lounge seating , high table , and quaint board games/books tucked in the corner . Obviously a lot of effort wa made to present itself a a `` hangout '' spot for patron and it would be a nice place to visit with friend in the evening . I wa craving some milk tea at the time so I chose the taro option with no ice . There were many menu item lined up along the wall in a stylish menu including coffee , matcha , latte , tea , etc . a well so you should n't have trouble finding what you want . I also noticed they had food item that were more than just desert . Although the clerk were nice and pleasant to communicate with when ordering . The drink ended up being alright , about on par with other place in the area ; I chose the 3/4 sugar option yet it wa n't sweet enough in my opinion .

The flavor wa a little bland for regular milk tea . The matcha green tea wa kind of bitter and grainy . In term of flavor , I did n't feel like this place compared to others around town . The costumer service wa disappointing . I asked to add more black tea to taste more of the flavor . The woman helping went to grab a Dixie cup , and tried pouring it into my drink . I did n't feel like it had enough tea so I kept having to walk back and forth to the trash can to pour out my drink . I wa wondering why she would n't do it behind the counter . I asked for more ice and she proceeded to hand me a cup instead of taking the drink back to pour it out and add more Ice . Not a place I 'd come back to for tea with all the con .

      "We were craving a boba tea and so far our experience have not matched the quality of the boba place in china town , Hawaii . After debating what to order we decided to go with 2 drink instead of 1 for each of u due to the higher price here . We went with a strawberry mango slush that wa said to use fresh fruit and a matcha tea that i wanted blended , which most boba place will offer at minimal or no charge . Once we got our boba drink , i wa let down when the `` real fruit '' slush tasted like a powdered version that didnt seem to have actual fruit . Normally when it is a fruit slush you can see strawberry seed or tiny chunk of mango imcorporated into the slush . I chose the matcha tea with boba because it wa a lot le pricey than the custom slush . However i wa unpleasantly surprised to see i wa charged for a matcha slush . I like the creaminess of a green tea milk tea and instead got a plain matcha slush with little to no milk . Basically i paid a lot extra to get my order wrong . We will probably not be coming back , especially due to the high price and lack of quality . \n",

Paying $ 20 for 3 drink and having to wait 30 plus minute for them is a disgrace . After waiting for 30 minute and watching an uber eats driver come in and pick up a bag of drink , my kid decided they no longer wanted their drink . I went to the counter to ask if they had even started making the last 2 drink from my order . The kid behind the counter looked puzzled and asked what 2 drink we were waiting for . I replied please just refund my money because my kid are tired and no longer want their drink . He then proceeds to tell me it will only take 30 second to make them , I again reply that I 'd just like a refund . He say `` whatever '' and go to the money box ( no cash register , just an iPad on a stand ) and hand me $ 9 cash for a refund . I then state `` my total wa $ 20.22 and you 're telling me $ 11 wa the cost of my thai Boba tea ? '' He reply `` I 'm not refunding you for the drink you got . '' I laugh and say `` I 'm not asking you to refund the drink I got . I 'm questioning why it wa $ 11 . '' He then asks me again what I ordered while appearing to look up my order on the iPad . He give me back $ 12 and some change and instead of questioning again why my thai Boba tea would have cost $ 8 , I just say thanks and leave . I 'm a reasonable person . If you make a mistake then apologize and offer to fix it , do n't be rude and short change someone . Maybe if you did n't write your order on post-it note they would n't get lost so easily . I 'll drive to chinatown for my next Boba tea , I 'd probably get it faster than waiting here . **update** if you leave a bad review for this place , be warned you 'll receive a barrage of notification the next day in the form of someone creating a fake account and insulting you repeatedly via compliment .

Even with the free drink upgrade , It only cemented my disgust for the drink , a I could barely finish half . Save your bubble tea money for something else instead , because I do n't recommend you spend it here . \n",

      "Was definitely expecting a lot better based on the good review . Our visit started out okay , trying one of the pork bun . The meat wa a little dry and the bun did n't taste that great but it wa tolerable . And then the noodle dish came out . Oh boy . The sauce is watery , the meat is verrrry scarce , and the noodle tasted just like the kind you buy at a supermarket and then boil up for a quick meal when you do n't have time to make actual food . It all kind of felt like a uni student had made what they thought wa a good dish and then served it to you . Service wa friendly though and they gave out some latte sample while we were there which were quite good ( matcha-flavored I believe ) , so who know , maybe the good review are based on those element . All I can advise is skip the noodle and maybe just grab a drink instead . \n",

      "I usually give good rating for boba drink spot , but this place did n't win my heart this time . I came in on the first hour of opening . At this time they were busy training people how to make rolled ice cream instead of entertaining myself trying to get in an order . I order couple of item and most of it RAN OUT . Like the strawberry matcha and sea salt . I wa highly upset . I wanted to walk out but my girlfriend wanted something to drink . So i ordered and i had my order wrong . I ordered Honey MILK tea . She gave me Regular Honey tea with no milk . I just wanted to get out of there because i did n't want to let them replace my order . The boba drink wa very bland so i had to forcefully finish it . I will probably not come back to this place anymore , since i know other place that are better . \n",

      "I simply just ca n't recommend Matcha 's soft-serve ice cream here . We initially tried coming here during the winter month but they were closed . After seeing the extensive coverage on social medium , we were excited to try this place but it did n't meet expectation . We went with the matcha and charcoal twist which wa $ 6 in a cone . The flavour and texture simply did n't resonate . Good ice cream is fundamentally creamy and matcha 's soft serve wa a lot more icy than it should have been . The end result is that you do n't have that creamy , delicate smoothness . In addition , the ice cream tasted 'powdery ' in texture and lacked flavour and boldness . The matcha wa weak and dilute and the charcoal wa entirely tasteless . To make matter worse , the soft serve is hallow in the centre , and the cone wa practically leaking from the bottom and melted quickly ; a sign that it 's mostly water . That being said , matcha should focus on and would benefit from making a high quality soft-serve . A creamy , and smooth soft-serve with bold authentic flavour would do wonder instead of focusing on gimmick . \n",

      "Two of u came here one evening around 9pm on a weekday . We wanted to try the matcha soft serve in a cone . When we arrived there , there wa one person working at the counter . She said she could make enough for one cone if we wanted to order the regular size Matcha soft serve . So we said sure , we 'd share it ! There wa no other soft serve flavour option available at that time . When we got the cone , it wa perhaps 3/4 filled with soft serve and so disappointing , especially because I think it wa greater that $ 6 - close the $ 7 maybe if not more ? We asked if she could top it up a little more and she offered to give u a mini cone instead , which wa nice , but still very small . Maybe it wa the time we went , but we felt like if there wa n't enough matcha soft serve left , we should have been told honestly . ( Also , I thought there would still be soft serve left at 9pm on a weekday , since they close at midnight ) I do n't think I 'll be coming here again . If you 're looking for matcha soft serve , visit Tsujiri nearby Yonge and Sheppard . \n",

      "LOL HYPE HYPE HYPE ! ! ! It is not real . I 've never been one to listen to toronto blog or `` instagram foodie '' in term of deciding where to eat . This place is just your ol ' typical asian soft serve ice cream . Comes in handy on a hot day but the taste is n't all there . The service here is alright , not fast but not slow . They take their time to make sure the ice cream sits perfectly on the cone . Matcha ice cream taste - very bland on matcha , the cone is whatever Red bean ice cream taste - this is the only thing here that brings the rating up . This is pretty unique and doe have a nice red bean flavour # WhenYouCarryTheTeam The regular ice cream are around $ 5 , I always get that mini one- I find the regular way too big . I also saw they have charcoal ice cream now- with gold flake ... it 's almost $ 12 ! ! ! Let me tell you.. charcoal ice cream is not that big of a hoot . It taste like straight vanilla . Gold flake also have no flavour . If you 're buying this , I guarantee you 're only buying it to take a pic for your instagram and if you 're a kind of person to splurge just to show off for social medium , I feel bad for ya man . But good on Matcha for knowing the # basic clientele they have nowadays , eh ? $ $ $ for them . ( haha I bet I just offended half of you reading this . As I always say- I never point out name , but if the shoe fit ... ) All in all , Matcha need to step up their matcha game . If you 're looking for a nice matcha flavour , I 'd go down to tendou and grab a cone there instead . \n",

      "Nothing really stand out about their drink and boba here , but the low rating is mainly pointed at their dessert toast . They did n't have any matcha left , I suppose , so we went with the regular one . It ended up being a very thin , small piece of white bread toasted with some condensed milk . I wa expecting thick , fluffy bakery or Texas toast sweetened with a special spread . For $ 4 , this tiny piece wa a huge disappointment . I 'll be going back to Spring Mountain and Icy Juicy for their Monster Toast instead of making this mistake next time . \n",

      "We came here probably 4 to 5 time a week ! It is soooo addicting ! ! ! I love their milk tea . It is so creamy almost like condensed milk . You have a choice to choose from green and black tea . My friend really like the winter melon tea cap and the mango green tea . Their boba is just right , but the pudding is too big to drink from the straw . I DEFINITELY recommend this place Second update : They have a new recipe and it is DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! It 's call the mango smoothie ! ! ! GET IT ! ! ! : ) \n",

      "I have come here over 20 time since they opened and tried various drink . The owner are always super friendly and they do n't hesitate to modify our drink to our liking ( adding more ice , adjusting sweetness etc . ) My favorite drink are the winter melon tea with cloud cap , white taro smoothie , watermelon smoothie , watermelon green tea , mango green tea , and green apple smoothie . This might seem like an exhaustive list , but I swear they are all really good . The boba also ha the perfect texture and sweetness . I will continue to come here to try new drink from their menu . Another bonus is that they open late ( midnight ) ! Protip : Ask for the fresh fruit menu ! \n",

What I love is their tv 's on the side with picture of some of their drink . There 's hand menu and a menu on top of the register where you order . Great selection and they even have decaf option that are marked on the menu . We ordered the pudding milk tea , mango green tea and winter melon mousse with the sea salt mousse . All there were delicious ! The sweet girl on the register wa so helpful . Gave me some recommendation and even let me sample the winter melon before getting it . I love it ! I would definitely recommend this place and I 'm so excited to try more of their flavor . If you 're looking for a place for good drink and a space to study or even just do some work , this is the spot to go to ! They even have a bar area where you can just chill and hang out . Happy drinking my fellow yelpers ! \n",

      "Huh.. never had a bubble tea I did n't like.. until today that is . I had a chance to try both the honey and the almond milk tea . They both tasted strongly of pre-made mix and not fresh at all , mind you I would n't count myself a overly picky either . Perhaps in the past this wa the best you could get around here , but there are much better option within ~5 minute of this place , and a metric ton of option if you 're willing to go a little further into Chinatown . I did not try any snack or food here so I ca n't comment on that . To their credit I did find the boba to be a nice consistency ( soft but not soggy ) and the people working there were polite and helpful . \n",

      "Liquid nitrogen ice cream is something you have to experience at least once . After a whole bunch of these nitrogen-themed shop pop up , you 've kinda tasted them all . The place itself is aesthetically pleasing . The actual ice cream , bubble waffle , and tea are alright . It 's fun to watch the ice cream being made , but I did n't like the texture that much . It 's too ... creamy ? Like it 'll melt once you walk out and are bombarded with the Vegas heat . They have limited flavor of ice cream , bubble waffle , and tea . The bubble waffle itself is pretty to look but not fun to eat . It wa crunchy ... not soft and waffle-y . I wa n't able to easily distinguish between vanilla , chocolate , or matcha bubble waffle . I also ordered a matcha tea . It wa a bit bland . I like that they make it unsweetened then you can add your own amount and type of sweetener . But they were very stingy on the ice . My drink wa a . It colder than room temp and wa not enjoyable . I had to drink a couple sip and then go ask for a whole bunch of ice to cool it down more . Eh , I wa n't impressed . The hype is not real . \n",

      "Really not worth the wait and money . I love boba and have tried so many place and this one 's the worst , the boba is over cooked and so soft , not the chewy kind most place offer . The drink are always way too sweet even though I ask for only half of one pump sweetener ( they usually put 4 I think ) , they always get my sugar level wrong even though I tell the cashier , and I have to get them to remake it . Also like to add that the shop is filthy , the floor is n't clean and I saw syrup around the floor . Bought boba here a few time and received same service every time . \n",

The boba itself wa good , soft and chewy , but both drink were watery and bland . The menu wa really confusing and hard to navigate . Luckily the line wa really long and service wa slow , so we had plenty of time to figure it out while we stood in line . Probably wo n't be going back . \n",

      "Being the only boba place in the mall , there 's no competition which make it so busy . I got my regular My Thai drink and it did n't taste like Thai tea , it tasted like milk . The boba wa super soft and sticky , better than being hard but still not ideal . Lots of choice for drink and add in and it 's honestly overwhelming . It 's expensive too for the size and quality of drink . I wish more boba place would open in Scottsdale so I could have a choice , but for now I 'll have to venture to the south east valley for better place . \n",

      "Same franchise company however the Rainbow Kung fu tea is clearly not the same owner a the Spring Mountain Kung fu tea . Ordered taro milk green tea w/herbal jelly : -I can taste the Taro -Herbal jelly is Very soft -I notice rainbow location make their herbal jelly a little sweeter than Spring Mtn . Location . I think I like it -Way too much milk made the drink too creamy -Taste no Green tea or any tea whatsoever which may have been overpowered by the excessive milk added . Service wa good . They had enough staff to be prepared for a busy night however there wa only two different group of customer when I walked in . Rainbow Kung Fu tea ha a large Square footage compared to Kung Fu on Spring Mtn . and Brew Tea across the street . I 'm sure they anticipated to be very busy and compete with Brew Tea right across the street . However , Brew Tea is winning for they have established extremely loyal client in the area due to their freshly brewed tea and the owner very welcoming smile and genuine customer service Looking forward to trying my other favorite drink in the future which will determine if my star go up or go down for this location Update : I have encountered unprofessional customer service more often than any other boba tea store in Las Vegas . -the worker behind the counter do not smile but instead all or most have a poker face or a face that scream they hate their job . -several occasion the male employee are yelling or swearing behind the counter . -I have notice smelling weed once when my friend and I were seated and chatting at our table for a good hour . Is Weed Tea on the menu ? Is this not a kid friendly environment ? That being said.. I would rather wait in long line at Brew Tea where the owner themselves greet and make your drink at least half the time and clearly Cares about their service and customer . \n",

      "If you like your drink already prepared , this is the place to go . ( My family like ours freshly made on the spot ) We ordered drink only to be disappointed & see them pour from pitcher so who know how long they were ready made & sitting for . They do n't really have other flavor drink other than what 's on their menu . Boba & the clear aloe Vera jelly boba wa good & soft though . They ca n't put a slush/smoothie in a split cup nor can they make it regular without the topping ? Odd . We were n't a fan of the strawberry bliss or peach blossom due to the chunky-ness of it , the strawberry horchata wa a different flavor too . I enjoyed my Thai tea but that 's a hard one to get wrong . Seating is kinda odd since it 's a small location , I think it 's not enough space from where you 're paying to the person at the table behind you ... so your bottom is kinda in their face . LOL .

      "The place exuberates a classical , minimalistic style a shown in the image of it decor . The staff that helped u were nice and helpful , but it end there . The place is supposed to be known for it drink ( it 's a boba place after all ) and my group and I ordered 4 ; we bought a classic drink that every boba place should have down : a black milk tea . Simple and sought after by classic boba lover ; if you ca n't get that right , the other drink are bound to be bad a well . While the wait wa fast , it showed how bad the drink really wa . There wa no care put into these drink at all . It wa watered down so that no tea flavor wa distinguishable or coming through , and the boba itself wa inconsistent . I wa getting a mouth full of water and semi-soft/hard boba pretty much . Boba is supposed to have it 's own flavor consisting of tapioca , sugar , and even honey ; boba is supposed to marinate in something sweet to add extra flavor to a drink rather than being a lonely rubber existence that life there . From my two visit already , I would n't return from what I have seen and tasted so far . It just seems like another place jumping on the boba and aesthetic hype rather than focusing on drink that others seek out for because of how great it is . \n",

But I wa back home for Thanksgiving and stopped by after getting dimsum and wa not very happy with my experience . I ordered the Matcha milk tea with boba , and I wa very disappointed . First , there wa only a hint of matcha coloring and flavor . I tasted like a normal milk tea with a hint of match aftertaste . When I order matcha , I 'm expecting the full blow of the green tea and that bitterness . And the boba wa very soft , too soft . It wa mushy , which I do not appreciate in my boba . And after being to different boba place around the country , it surprise me that Boba Tea House still doe n't have an option to change the level of sugar in your drink . Every other boba place I 've been to in other part of the country allow you to adjust your sugar . This wa actually the first place where I tried boba , so I have very fond memory , but I think there are much better boba place out there . I do n't think I will be returning here . \n",

      "Review 777 on St. Paddy 's ... lucky review for me ? Hope so ! What 's this ? Trendy Asian dessert in the middle of Streetsville ? Wow I would have never expected to have this in the middle of a run down strip mall . This maybe the first Japanese cheesecake spot I 've seen outside of a mall in GTA west . The spot is take out only a there are no table or even a bar stool . It 's quite sparse but there is an adorable cute cartoon of an astronaut rabbit and his adventure . The moon crater in the drawing are almost a big a the pot hole in the parking lot . My visit here on a Friday afternoon wa quiet at first with a single person behind the counter . Within a few moment , a line of 4 people just sprouted . Because there wa only one person , the 4 people just waited and waited . Do n't get me wrong , it wa a nice staff person but it 's still frustrating to wait and have no service . So there are 2 main offering ... the Japanese cheesecake and the cheese tart . The Japanese cheesecake is very different . It 's supposed to be a fluffy cotton soft texture that melt in your mouth . I 'm not sure how it is here a they do n't offer single slice . They also have bubble tea and hot drink but I think their main item are the cake and tart . The cheesecake come in several flavour : sweet cheese original , chocolate , red velvet , and their monthly flavour mocha . If you want the fluffy Japanese cheesecake , bring friend cause they only sell the one full cake for $ 12 . No slice sadly . The tart are small and $ 3 each . Original cheese tart - I appreciated how they were just cooking a fresh batch and we got ours just out of the oven . Since they do n't sell slice of the cheesecake , we got cheese tart instead . They are shortbread crumbly crust wa minimal flavour and filled to the brim with a creamy dense liquid cheese filling . It 's almost like a molten traditional cheesecake . The flavour is unmistakably sweet Philadelphia cream cheese . Though the creamy texture is quite nice , I 'm not sure if there is anything great that make me go `` ohhh I need more '' . Still a fairly nice tart 3.5/5 Strawberry bubble tea - huh ... for $ 6 this wa smaller than the small bubble tea of most other place . I think Chatime would be only $ 4 . This drink wa sadly watered down . I felt it wa not balanced with the amount of ice in it . Overall too small , too expensive , and no real flavour - 2/5 Matcha bubble tea - this wa slightly better than the strawberry but not really . It wa n't watery a much but still lacking good flavour that I would expect for $ 6 for a small cup . It wa missing a good matcha flavour . Not very good unfortunately 2.5/5 Overall , I like the look of the cute place but the lack of great flavour and higher cost make me think there 's better out there . \n",

      "Wow , and not in a good way ... Special hour today for the soft open said they opened at 12pm . I 'm always looking for the next greatest thing so I ventured out . I figured I would get to Zero Degrees before opening to beat the crowd . When I got there just before noon the line wa already formed and stretched outside to the door . The line seemed to move very slowly . There wa only one register open and there were many other people making drink . From the time that we arrived to the time that we left with our drink it wa an hour ! ! Seriously , an hour ? ? ? I know it 's the soft opening but it 's boba drink , not fine dining . The drink were `` meh '' , meaning I 've had better . Typically `` meh '' earns a three star review . `` Meh '' quality combined with a one hour wait = BAD . I ca n't imagine that people will tolerate this wait regularly . If they expect to be busy Zero Degrees ha to step up their game .

Their milk tea offering are not a huge selection . After browsing for a few minute I decided on a taro milk tea which wa more like a thinned out taro slush . I do n't think there wa tea in it . It wa flavorful and had bit of taro in it . Boba wa standard soft chewy and a bit mushy . Next time I 'd like to try a smoothie since they add fresh fruit in their smoothy .

I like having option but this place need to change the menu style so that customer can pick a blended drink or tea based or coffee drink much more quickly . As for the boba itself it 's too soft , which mean it 's over cooked , 1 minute le and it would be perfect . Flavor is good , I got the Cabana Boy with boba instead of the yogurt thingies ... . Which I had to tell her to change at the last minute - again cuz it 's confusing and they just stared at me ! -_- \n",

      "Cafe Summer is another cute eatery new to the neighborhood and in my opinion it 's a bit on the cute side . But that 's what make it attractive right ? I have to admit I did come here just to check out what this fish shape ice cream cone thing ( I believe it 's called Taiyaki ) wa all about . Located in a brand new shopping strip on Rainbow just off of Blue Diamond next to the Churches Chicken is where you will find this lovely quant place . I believe it might be a Korean inspired cafe slash Boba slash desert place but I 'm not too sure . Anyhow the inside is decorate very cute with cool art or drawing that are painted on the wall . Even though it 's not that big it 's not too small either very comfy . With table and chair lining each side and a food/drink counter straight ahead a you walk in . I ordered of coarse the Fish waffle Ice cream cone , a rainbow drink aka the orange Yuzu I think , drink ( which the ran out of ) and the pork belly stew with rice . The ice cream came with a choice of 3 topping or stuff to go in it . In reality you only get two topping because they consider the ice cream a topping which make no sense to me because I would think the ice cream is the base and the topping is a topping . It 's not like you would order the cone with marshmallow , chocolate syrup and poke stick without ice cream that 's 3 topping STUPID . They should just offer 2 topping at this point SMH ! And to finally talk about the Fish shape cone . They look cool but taste so dry and flavor wa a fail . To me it tasted like old wheat bread with no flavor at all . `` Sorry '' to spoil it for those of you who are really excited to try it if you have n't but it wa meh , not that great . It came out not that quickest either . They ran out of the rainbow drink so I did n't get to try that and the wait for the food wa a bit long so I had to change it to To Go since my 1 year old and 3 year old wa getting a little cranky . I took the girl out into the car since I felt bad for disturbing the other guest who some were reading and on their laptop . The employee were really nice and brought my food outside to my car for me once it wa done . The rice bowl or since I got it to go the rice foam plate wa consist of the braised pork belly , soft white rice , 2 different pickle veggie ( which I could n't figure out what the other veggie wa ) and a hard boiled . So I 've recently got the Bariatric surgery so I wa n't able to eat it all but I wa able to try everything . The pork belly wa a 2 out of 5 in my opinion flavor wa lacking and the pickle wa a bit bland and meh . The rice wa good but it wa just rice and the egg had a slight weird flavor to it . All in all they 're the same sort of dish in the Philippines , Laos , Thai and even Chinese cuisine the sweet braised tender pork belly stew over rice which is my favorite but their version here at Cafe Summer I would skip . Any how to sum it up Cafe summer is a more Looks better then it Taste kind of place . Never the le a very cute place , friendly service , price is ummmm so so and a lot of people raf about their drink so I have to come and give that another try and see if at least the drink can score good point . \n",

      "My friend and I became interested in Café Summer after seeing post on Instagram that showcased beautiful drink , taiyaki , and other tasty treat . The café had fairly positive review so we decided to give it a try when we hung out not too long ago . Unfortunately , the experience wa not at all what we expected it to be and ended in quite a bit of disappointment . When my friend and I arrived , no one greeted u and the place wa not crowded . We stood by the counter , reading the menu on the wall for several minute before someone eventually told u to go sit down and brought u menu . We were waiting for three other friend to arrive , so we browsed the menu for a while . When our friend arrived shortly after , we continued to wait for someone to come over so that we could make our order . After waiting for a noteworthy amount of time , the waitress came around and allowed u to order . We requested separate check for each order ahead of time so that the payment process would n't be too complicated later on . Around 30 minute later , we had not received any of our beverage or other request . While I would not have expected food to have been prepared instantly due to the size of our group , at most restaurant , drink order would have at least been fulfilled by this point . The waitress came back and informed someone in our group that they were out of Mt . Charleston Toast and that he would have to order a different toast option instead . He ordered another toast from the menu and we continued to wait . Within an hour of waiting time , I had finally received the drink that I ordered . Although the Orange Yuzu is supposed to be served with a light to illuminate the beautiful gradient effect associated with the drink , the café wa apparently out of light or only two worked , so I did n't get to experience the drink a it had been advertised . This wa slightly disappointing for me since this beverage wa one of the main reason I had come to this café ( aside from the taiyaki ) , but I wa growing increasingly more disappointed by the slow service and lack of communication from the staff . And somehow , people who had just walked into the café were getting their order immediately while we were still waiting for ours , even with an hour passing . Eventually my order of takoyaki wa brought out , but it wa lukewarm and did not have much octopus inside at all . Two of my friend ordered pork belly rice and stew rice , which they were displeased with for a few reason . Not only did their order look nothing remotely like the image shown on the menu , but the proportion of the serving were definitely not a expected or portrayed . 75 % of these dish were rice , followed by two or three spoonful of meat , vegetable , etc . Priced at around $ 9 to $ 10 , you would n't expect that the majority of your plate would be covered in plain white rice with only a few of the additional ingredient . When the toast order arrived , it wa missing the fruit . A peach tea wa brought to one of the people in our group and it wa extremely sweetened to the point that he could n't even enjoy it ; when the order wa made , the staff also did n't tell u that sweetness could be varied upon request either . After being at the café for an hour and thirty minute , my taiyaki wa brought out along with garlic squid ball . Since I had ordered taiyaki along with another friend , somehow our order were mixed up and they were not prepared correctly at all . Keep in mind , this taiyaki wa another main reason I had wanted to visit this café . I wa extremely disappointed with the poor preparation of my request . One would hardly guess it wa a taiyaki at all . The taiyaki wa soft , floppy , and hardly stable enough to even hold . Not even remotely crispy . The ice cream I had requested wa incorrect . Upon eating the ice cream off , I discovered that there were marshmallow inside the taiyaki to try to maintain the shape , which wa not advertised at all . After eating the marshmallow , I then discovered that there wa custard at the bottom , but it wa only around half of a tablespoon 's worth and that estimate might be grossly generous . I could n't even finish the rest of the taiyaki because it wa so doughy and basically impossible to enjoy . As my friend waited for her taiyaki , it became increasingly clear that more mistake had been made . Her taiyaki wa also incorrect . The staff kept taking taiyakis to the wrong table , brought another table 's order to u , and even told one of the customer 's across from u that they were completely out of boba pearl . We also saw a staff member coming in randomly with a box of supply , which seemed to suggest that they had left to go pick up more ingredient that they had previously run out of earlier . This same friend did n't receive her drink until we paid before leaving , which wa two hour after our initial order . Payment wa also an ordeal since the check were separated incorrectly and I wa nearly overcharged with the wrong item . \n",

      "My experience at this bubble tea place wa bad ! Bubble tea : I got Lychee and the sweetness wa absolutely overpowering . It wa so bad , I wished they had just dumped some water in there to thin it out . I also tried strawberry and that wa also too sweet . Bleh ! Boba : At first , I wa delighted . The texture wa great , not overly chewy or too soft . The subtle flavor wa also present . BUT a the minute passed , the boba started to freeze and instead of that black translucent color , I got light brown boba ! I could n't even bite through those freakin frozen ball . Argh ! $ $ $ $ : Are they freakin out of their mind ? ? This stuff wa not worth a quarter of the price ! They are not realistic at all . It 's not even on the strip , but they charge more for a drink than an entire meal I could get in the same complex . Service : This wa the last straw ! I 'm usually very patient , since I also work in customer service , but the waitress just blew me off when I asked for the bill . Doubly Bleh and Argh ! I will never stop by this place again . Okay , I 'm sure they have other drink that may be tasty , but I put a huge emphasis on customer service . Tea Station , you have lost me a a customer forever ! ! \n",

'' And so he tried getting the almond milk tea instead and the server said `` we ONLY have the flavor we do n't have almond milk ! '' So he settled for the earl grey tea . I decided to get the matcha green tea ice cream drink with boba like I usually do . Problem this time wa my boba wa not soft at all . The flavor wa also barely there . Why should I pay over 10 $ for horrible customer service AND horrible boba when I could spend a lot le and be greeted with patience and smile elsewhere .

The flavor wa somewhat bland , and it had way more pork fat than meat itself . This reminded me of an extreme knockoff version of the Vietnamese dish `` Thit Kho '' ( Vietnamese Braised Pork and Eggs ) . My friend got the tea-flavored Chicken Teriyaki . It wa super salty , just like my friend 's feeling after spending $ 9+ for it ! Matcha Milk Tea with Ice Cream : Got it because of the hype . Very light matcha flavor . Royal Milk Tea with Boba : Rich and had a lot of flavor . Boba wa soft . Would recommend . Overall , the food plate were definitely not worth $ 9+ ; we could have spent those elsewhere . In addition to the iffy food , service wa not up to par a well . We did not have any silverware once we got our food , so we had to get the attention of a different waiter .

Was n't that bad but mango tasted spoiled a well . Their lychee jelly tasted very soury . They forgot to put in my order of crispy chicken , so I guess they made it in a hurry so when I got the chicken , it wa very soft and no flavor to it . Usually their chicken taste very good , but I do n't know if it the new hired waitress or just the owner doe n't care his store , but I wo n't be coming here anymore . To be honest right after we got our order , we immediately paid and went across the street to Fresh Cup , which saved our night . \n",

      "Yeah I do n't know what all the hype about this place is about . The first time I heard about this place wa when my friend told me that Icy Juicy make drink comparable to those at Tea Station , but at a cheaper price . Being the boba lover that I am , I wanted to try this place out for myself . The first time I went , I wa on my way home from work so I wanted to place an order for take-out . When I went in , the waitress handed me the menu and wa literally tapping her foot while I perused the menu a if to say `` Hurry up , you 're wasting my time ! '' And mind you , it took me le than 2 minute to decide what I wanted . Then when I reached in my wallet to pay with my debit card , she said , `` We ca n't use card for purchase under $ 10 ( it could 've been $ 15 , I forgot ) . '' Nowhere at the cash register wa there a sign telling me that they did n't accept card for order under such and such . Luckily I did have cash with me that day or otherwise it would 've been game over . Their peppermint milk tea is almost the same a the one at Tea Station , I 'll give them that . The boba is a bit too soft for me , almost a if it 's been sitting in the pot for too long . Prices are decent , about $ 2- $ 4 for a drink . They do have cooked dish and snack option , but I have not tried any so far . Icy Juicy is open late so I suppose it is an alternative to Tea Station , but I honestly do n't see what the big deal is about . Perhaps I need to give this place another try . \n",

The selection of baked good is something like a grocery store . Did n't see anything special . I could have went to the vons by my house and got the same thing . I ended up ordering a green tea boba . After ordering , my wife and I just sat there in silence and the owner/worker just stood there awkwardly and did n't talk to u . Once we left , I tried the boba , and it wa OK. Until , I got to the boba part . The boba wa n't chewy or soft . When I bit into it , it felt like it wa still defrosting or something . I do n't know if my expectation for boba and baked good are too high , but needle to say that we wo n't be going back unfortunately . \n",

The girl behind the counter deserves five star because she wa pleasant , but I 'm knocking off four star for a number of reason . 1 . The place smell like a petting zoo . Do they sell boba for pet here ? What 's with the wet animal stench ? 2 . Why , why , why doe the credit card pad ask for a tip when you order and no service ha been performed yet ? ? I hate place that do this . Is it a millennial thing ? It make no sense . How about make me a drink and I 'll see if a tip is deserved ?

The boba is way overdone ... .soft and mushy , no gumminess at all . These are the same issue I have encountered at Scoop and I have been here about 12 time ... ..I would say 4 of those time I received boba that wa good , the rest of the time the boba is either soft and mushy or ha a super hard center that you ca n't even chew .

      "Scoop is a tiny shop with a random anime/ video game theme going on . Based on other Yelp review , it seems a though they are primarily an ice cream shop but also sell boba and food item . I got an Oreo macaron ice cream sandwich with green tea ice cream and a small milk tea with boba . The Oreo macaron in the display case looked tasty , but upon receiving my order the macaron I wa given looked nothing like the display . There were tiny crumb of Oreo baked into the macaron but none on top . Not a big deal , but when I asked about it , the worker said , `` oh , they must have forgotten to sprinkle the Oreo on top . '' Ohhhhkay . Texture-wise , it wa kind of hard with a flat sugary flavor . The green tea ice cream had no green tea flavor , and wa melted . The boba wa cheap- $ 2.50 for a small . The milk tea itself wa decent . Some other Yelpers mentioned that their tapioca wa hard , though the one I got were overly soft and tasteless . Cheap , yes , but unfortunately you get what you pay for . I feel a though Scoop is a good concept that suffers from excessive menu item and poor execution . Maybe instead of offering dozen of thing , they should pick a few and do them well . Do n't really have a reason to return . \n",

Its quite the drive away from the strip but I figured we give it a try cause I needed my ice cream and milk tea fixing . Customer service wa RUDE RUDE RUDEEEE ! The guy made u feel like we an annoyance and interrupting whatever movie he wa watching . He told u that there wa no boba in case that 's what we came for . We asked him how long would it take and he kinda just laughed under his breath and said ' i dunno ... maybe 30 minute ? ' We opted for a macaron ice cream sandwich and scoop of ice cream . Maybe I 'm spoiled to have amazing mac sandwich choice at home but wow their mac sandwich were a disappointment . They stick it in a cup in which you cant even pull it out without it falling apart . Ice cream wa wayyy too soft that it did n't even hold any form . I ended up having to break the macaron shell with my spoon and just scooping it with ice cream . Ended up only eating half of it and throwing the rest away . Nothing spectacular or unique about their ice cream . I feel like you can get better tasting ice cream at the local grocery store . \n",

We ordered a chocolate chip cookie sandwich with white chocolate macadamia nut ice cream ( $ 3.5 ) and a taro and almond milk tea ( $ 4ea ) . We received it fairly quickly but left a lot to be desired almost instantly . The ice cream wa already soft and melted . It did n't even hold for one bite . The rest had to be eaten with a spoon and truthfully one scoop of ice cream is not enough for two decadent cooky . At the very least the cooky were soft and tasty . The two drink at first sip were so bland . Not sweet in the least . The boba wa perfectly soft and were the only source of sweetness but not enough to make it enjoyable . I took my drink home and added my own sweetener . Did n't want my bf 's Sunday treat to go to waste . I just wonder if all the hype wa because of the yelp promos and the younger crowd that seems to be drawn here . I think I may have had a better experience if I had just ordered ice cream , but even then i would only give it three star . Sorry Scoop . Just not my cup of tea . \n",

We ordered two drink : classic milk tea and almond milk tea . They gave me what they had left and the boba wa a huge disappointment . It wa hard , not soft and chewy and also had no sweetness or taste to it . I do not recommend their boba . Their two drink have a much stronger tea taste than a sweet milk taste . The classic milk tea is made with black tea whereas the almond milk tea is made with green tea . The only thing I enjoyed wa the almond milk tea , probably because I love green tea but if you are not a big tea person , it might not suit your taste .

It wa really big , but that 's no problem since it wa almost a whopping $ 10 for it . It also came with a lot of strawberry . For me , it wa too much . There were three of u there and we still could n't finish it . I also got a strawberry smoothie with boba which wa okay . The boba wa hard , yuck . Not enjoyable . My boyfriend also got an apple pie . It wa about $ 5 for a slice and he did n't finish that either . He said wa `` okay '' and `` nothing special .

The first time we visited wa during the soft opening in the beginning of the year . It did not make a lasting impression ( good or bad ) so we never came back ; however , after having dinner nearby , my boyfriend and I decided to come here instead of our usual boba joint . Big mistake . The menu ha several option ranging from slush to smoothy , milk tea , and fruit drink . You also have the option to add different type of jelly a well . Upon ordering , I opted for the lychee slush with lychee jelly . The cashier asked if I preferred a smoothie or slush and explained the difference . I once again said lychee slush . After my boyfriend ordered , she repeated what we said and asked if we wanted boba . I said `` No thank you , but I want lychee jelly please ! '' . The order took over five minute to come out , despite the fact that no one else wa there . Once the order came out , it wa wrong . There wa no lychee jelly and the slush wa extra watery . Normally I would n't complain , but the drink wa pretty bad and the lychee would be it one redemption . As soon a I confronted the cashier and asked for lychee jelly , both woman got defensive and blamed me . The manager started up setting up the register for me to pay an additional 50 cent for lychee jelly and kept saying that it wa my fault that I did n't correct the cashier when she repeated the order . I honestly would n't mind paying the measly 50 cent , even if it wa their fault , but due to their rude demeanor , I just cancelled the order and threw my drink away a soon a I walked outside . Overall , I would rate the drink 2/5 ( my boyfriend 's fruit tea wa decent ) and the service 1/5 . We ended up making the drive to our usual spot after . If you know me , you know that I will continue drinking something even if I 'm not a fan ; however , I will never make a visit to here ever again . To all future customer , make sure you articulate and repeat what you want at least five time or else your order will most likely come out wrong . \n",

Then we were told that if we want a cold drink , we would need to pick another one . She told u to pick any other drink on the board , so we picked another one . Then she talked to the guy and again for couple minute , and then informed u that the one we pick cost more than the sakura green tea , so she need u to pick another one . Then the guy came up once again . He told u we are fine as-is and he will do that for u this time . We were standing in front of the counter that whole time for just a simple order . Quite disappointed on this experience . We do n't like how the staff need to go back-and-forth with another staff , not sure if that is the owner . She could have just make a simple decision to satisfy the guest and prevent u for a long wait while listening to a foreign language that we do n't understand at all . Plus , the place is not well-decorated and Boba is not well-cooked . Fake HK style egg waffle . We definitely wo n't come back again . \n",

      "I came here for boba and left very disappointment . I had the brown sugar milk tea with boba and could n't even get myself to finish it . The boba wa overcooked and way too soft , the texture wa terrible . I thought the tea wa disgustingly sweet and I 'm known for having a sweet tooth . The tea wa just way too much to handle . Only giving 2 star because the man working there when I went wa incredibly nice and helpful . Their ice cream and macaroon look good so if you 're gon na go I suggest sticking with that instead . \n",

      "-- My First Impression -- I have been to this Chatime several time . I do n't really enjoy my visit a lot because they always mess up my order . Since Yelp is hosting the `` Order the Yelp '' event , I thought it wa a perfect time to revisit them and order the Yelp drink . The associate in the store did n't seem to know the promotion at all . I showed them my check in and told them I would like to redeem the 50 % off promotion . They told me there wa no such promotion . I showed them my Yelp check in and told them I would like to order that drink . They still insisted they did n't have that drink , but still they honoured my discount . It seems that they never have what I want to order : 1 . There wa no Yelp Drink ( a per all store associate ) 2 . They did n't have strawberry kiwi juice that day 3 . They did n't have tapioca at that time and required extra waiting time for them to make the new batch . -- Food and Drink -- 1 . Taiwan Mango QQ Juice ( I wa trying to order the `` Order The Yelp ! '' drink - Mango Twist , since they claimed they did n't have their drink , they made the Taiwan Mango QQ Juice for me ) . The juice wa surprisingly refreshing and wa n't too sweet . Since we got a fresh batch of tapioca , the tapioca wa quite soft . 2 . Grapefruit QQ Juice - I found this drink wa just average compared to other chatime branch . They added too much water in it . -- Overall -- I have a feeling this store is always running out of inventory . They have trouble maintaining the quality of their drink ( sometimes their drink are overly-sweet , sometimes they are watered down ) . Not a fan of this Chatime . I would only come back if my friends/family want to get a bubble tea here . \n",

      "As a Californian , this place wa interesting . There are plenty of boba place in CA . There are plenty donut place . But there is NO place that ha boba & donut ! After 1 week of hard work , we were craving for boba . Surprisingly , the donut were good even at 7pm - soft and puffy . The problem with this place wa service . We came in when a couple of thinking about what to order . So , nicely , they told u that we can go first . Keep in mind , we ordered our stuff by phoning in 30 minute . Still , our drink were not ready . : -/ The couple waited for 15 minute before they could make their order . Felt bad , a they waited for a while to make an order .

      "so I actually gave this place a shot again ... well same result kung fu tea . boba wa really hard and chewy . I also brought my sister from California here and she also agreed . I know you guy got really offended here last time I wrote a review that Dominic tried to give me a lesson in boba . so since he wa so confident I 'd enjoy my drink here I decided to give you guy the benefit of the doubt . I will give you guy this though when you give the customer their drink you tell them to try it and if you do n't like it you 'll fix it to our liking . unfortunately because we brought boba for my nephew at home we kind of had to rush home or else I would 've told you guy . I 'm not trying to sound like the king of boba or a guru because Im afraid you guy might not like the criticism and try to give me a lesson again about boba getting hard in a cold drink which I still find myself LMAO about it . but just to let you know and I 'm hoping you guy will take this a a way to improve is that I have had boba that wa really soft in my drink from milk tea , to slushies , to snow bubble to whatever you want to call it . I love your confidence in replying to my first review and challenging me to come back but now that you 've failed again what doe that mean for you guy ? IMPROVE your boba please . but because you offered to fix my drink even though I did n't . you get a 2 star rating . thanks for the drink but not the boba .

I 'm kinda confused ... .and their boba texture is leaning towards hard . Not very good . I enjoy boba that are chewy soft , not mushy or too hard . If you ca n't get that right , then the whole drink go horribly wrong . I guess boba here in Vegas ca n't really compare to boba in OC or LA : ( \n",

      "I wa very excited to try this place after Yelp 's review but it wa very disappointing ... Price : Steam for just an 16oz bottle . They only have one size which is 16oz bottle with lid . I 've been trying so many boba place but $ 3.99 for 16oz plus $ .50 for boba is a steam for me . I felt like I pretty much paid extra money for the plastic bottle which I thought it wa useless . It 's cute but why do we need a lid for 16oz boba drink ? ( To save if for later ? 16oz is not much for that and also I wa thinking if I save it for later I have to take the straw out from the bottle and have to save the straw , too ? ) Taste : Not so good I normally only try regular flavor tea or House milk tea to try new boba place . I tried the House milk tea because they did n't have regular tea w/o milk on the menu and they told u I can order w/o milk but it would be the same price . ( Regular tea w/o milk is much le anywhere . ) The House milk tea wa not great . I did n't even finish it . ) Boba : Good ( nice and soft ) Place : Cute and relaxing The place is a very nice set up and cute but that 's about it . I would not come back . : ( \n",

The boba ( tapioca , pearl , bubble , etc ... ) is probably the worst I have ever had . It wa hard , inconsistent , and overall just not right . Some of the boba were super soggy , then really hard , OR a combination of both ... a soft outer and hard center . I ordered the coconut milk tea , which wa not that bad . It wa made quickly and the worker were pleasant . I just can not forgive Easy Life for the poorly made boba here . ... ..backtrack ~3 year ago when fluffy snow wa gaining popularity . I came all the way here from Henderson to try some . Ordered the thai tea fluffy snow topped with condensed milk and mochi . This wa easily forgettable and not impressive at all .

      "As a regular of over six year , I have quite a lot to say about this company . The first time I walked in this shop wa when I wa in grade seven . I had recently made two new friend in school , who were eager to show `` little white Bridget '' some Asian culture . I walked in from the scorching Vegas heat into the cool blue store and wa amazed . Granted , it wa nothing special , looking back , white table and chair , stainless steel counter , and blue wall that looked like water filled with air . And the menu ! Huge , with ton of drink to choose from , from tea to smoothy to slushies ! Coming from a very secluded section of Indianapolis , I had never even heard of a slushie up until that moment . My friend ( Heuna and Michelle ) told me to get boba in my drink , and me , being in a daze , quickly agreed and got a black tea , something I wa familiar with . And when I got my drink , they both watched me in awe to gauge my reaction . I pierced the sealed plastic top with the oversize straw and had my first sip . I wa so happy that moment that I could die . The tea tasted amazing , the perfect amount of sweet and flavor . And the boba wa soft and chewy . A very nice compliment to the delicious tea . That first sip began my love affair with boba . Now it 's six year later . I 'm ( somewhat ) le naive than I previous wa . I 've been a loyal customer for all these year , spending my lunch money each day so I could get my fix of the good stuff , if you will . I 've tried almost every flavor , and always stick with the tea . This shop is good at what they do , which is make great drink and pretty amazing boba . There 's only one thing that ha bothered me about this location . The staff . You would think that being a customer for so long , the entire crew would know my name by now , right ! ? While they are friendly when you first come in , over time , if you come in too often , it seems like they do n't give a damn about you . I like to come into a store and feel WELCOME , not treated like I 'm some loud mouthed little kid , out to destroy your restaurant , or some unpleasant interruption from your riveting discussion on how cute so-and-so look today . If I want any sort of nice service there , I almost feel like I have to be a cute guy . If you 're going to do a job , especially for a long a the majority of the employee have been there , do n't half as it . Do it right , treat each customer kindly and fairly . Maybe I have different standard on how business should be run ( which , by the way , I will be opening my own boba shop with my boyfriend in the near future ) or maybe I 'm still bitter about being told I could n't work there , despite all the hoop and obstacle I had to go through just trying to get to the shop on my first day . Oh , I 'm sorry , silly me , I 'm writing a review of the business , not how rude the store owner wa to me that day , and how I STILL go in there and give him my hard earned wage . To make an OVERLY LENGTHY review short , yes , I would recommend this spot for a quick craving fix . They are good at what they do . They have great consistency in flavor and the texture of the boba . Just do n't expect to be treated like you 're anything special , despite the price you 'll pay for the drink . I hope sharing my story wa somewhat helpful to someone out there . I 'll always hold a soft spot in my heart for this place . So many wonderful thing have happened behind the door of this place . Thanks for reading ! : ] \n",

      "I find the high rating for this place to be completely baffling . Maybe I came in on a bad night , you know , someone being off their game . But , I think 2 star is pretty generous if you ask me , why ? This wa probably the worst bubble tea i 've ever had . Ever . I wa in the area and wa checking around for some new bubble tea place that were closeby . After seeing the high rating , I decided to check it out . The inside of the store is pretty nice . It 's clean and well maintained . Things started to go downhill after ordering a bubble tea . Large Milk tea w boba and egg pudding and caramel- Let 's start with the boba . It wa not well cooked . It wa mushy on the outside and hard in the middle . Definitely disappointed . The egg pudding wa ghastly . It wa way too soft . By the time it get sucked through the straw , it disintegrates into a cottage cheese like texture . I almost wanted to puke . The milk tea had 0 % tea flavor , it might a well have been water . And finally the cherry on top would be the caramel . They use the Torani brand caramel syrup . Yes , the same caramel syrup they use at Starbucks to flavor their drink . I mean , come on . It wa terrible . It should have been 1 star but I gave them an extra star because the total wa 4 buck with the yelp check in offer . But , not coming back . \n",

      "Boba 101 : Make sure your boba is fresh , soft , and chewy ! Popped in after a looong Saturday . I really did n't want to stop by but this other boba place is n't open yet and the driver wa calling the shot . We were gon na try this place out despite me whining about how Karen W. did n't like this place which mean I wo n't like it either . Bias ? Of course ! Karen is a gem and you best heed her advice ! ; ) So we got the Sea Salt Green Tea with boba and a Milk Tea 101 with pudding . I must say that unlike Karen 's experience , my green tea wa n't bitter . It wa however confusing . My drink looked different than Karen 's and I ca n't find any other Yelp picture of the same drink so I ca n't validate this a a norm but my drink had these weird white thing in it . I thought at first that maybe it wa like how Boba Tea Company add weird chunky stuff for texture but it wa n't crunchy . So maybe the sea salt crema curdled ? I 'm not sure but it kinda irked me . The boba itself is insanely soft ... like to the point where it can dissolve in your mouth without chewing . Uh , what ? As for the Milk Tea 101 [ or is it 101 Milk Tea ? I forget ] , it wa okay . Easily overlooked and forgettable . We were not fan . I did n't even grab a stamp card . $ 8-something for two drink . With all these new place in the valley , why settle for `` Meh ?

Not a big fan of the super soft bobas . My cousin got a drink and when he poked his straw in , the cup cracked and the drink spilt everywhere . The worker were so oblivious to what wa going on while every one in the cafe wa staring at u while we tried to contain the liquid inside the cup . We were in a hurry and could n't wait for a new one . Not that they even offered ... They gave u a new cup to put over the broken one which had practically nothing left but boba . They did not seem to care about what happened whatsoever . Yall need better supply cause those cup were hella thin ! And work on the customer service while you 're at it \n",

      "This is inside the 99 Ranch Market shopping center . I do n't know what people see in this place . They have nice table , cheerful lighting , and seat outside for you to sit . Plus , it 's busy so you see young people in and out . Other than that , I do n't care for their boba . So my favorite boba place wa closed and I wanted durian , you know , to annoy your white friend with the smell . As it wa 10pm I wasnt sure where else to go and Volcano wa nearby . So I went in and asked if they had durian . Yup . Fresh ? No kinda they said , 50/50 . My butt . When I got it it wa 99 percent powder and 1 sliver of durian fruit ( what do you call that fibrous material that get stuck in between your teeth when sucking out mango seed ? that stuff ) . It wa so creamy and powdery that I couldnt finish it . I did n't want to finish it truth be known . I dont know maybe some people like this creamy boba but I did not . I went home and stuck it in the fridge . The boba ball became hard and floury the next day . I am pretty sure the one from No 1 stayed soft even the next day . All the fruit that No 1 us are easily displayed in front of you . When you order the durian , you can smell that pungent and obnoxious smell . I did n't smell crap from Volcano when they made mine . Sure it 's trendy looking and there are cute girl working there a opposed to the housewife at No1 but I didnt come here to pick up a girl ... .just to pick up a milk tea drink . But like I said , if you are in it for the ambiance or like creamy milk tea this is the place to go . If you want more of a smoothie boba with real fruit , go inside the bland chinatown mall and visit No 1 . \n",

I 've been here a few time and I 've tried their dragon milk tea , coconut milk tea , lavender milk tea , and panda milk tea . All of them have been a disappointment . Their food pay the price for their bland drink , a they are filled with ton of spice . The spice on their garlic parmesan fry is so heavy , you really ca n't eat it without dipping it in a ton of ketchup . Their fish ball were a disaster . Their salt and pepper calamari were a catastrophe . The only redeeming factor about this place is the fact that they have board game you can play if you wan na hang out and chill with your friends/family . And their bulgogi fry is alright . Honestly , save your money . Stay away from this place . Go to a better boba place . \n",
